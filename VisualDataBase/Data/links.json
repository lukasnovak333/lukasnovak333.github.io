            "text": "According to the registrar this course covers major diseases cancer diabetes heart disease infectious diseases the design constraints for treatment and emerging technologies that take into account these physical hurdles Taking the perspective of the design constraints on the system that is the mass transport and biophysical limitations of the human body the course surveys recent results from the fields of drug delivery gene therapy tissue engineering and nanotechnology That is a pretty accurate description of the course The course contains 4 modules in the following sequential order diabetes infectious diseases cancer and cardiovascular disease Each module contains 2 3 introductory classes regarding how the disease works how it impacts the body its prevalence and incidence etc The next 1 2 classes discuss the current treatment options as well as limitations constraints of those treatments The last class tends to focus on emerging therapeutic options for that specific disease condition There are 3 lectures done by the TAs 1 for each and two guest lectures a semester as well Furthermore there are a few opportunities to complete dissections of actual organs to better understand the anatomical considerations of each module This semester Nelson was able to procure for the class sheep lung pancreata and pig hearts multiple so that students once well gloved could inspect them further cut them apart etc Nelson was always careful to announce these classes in advance so that those who were squeamish regarding blood would be able to skip this part of the course In terms of grading homework 50 final project proposal 10 final project 30 due by Deans Date and class participation 10 Be sure to take detailed notes in class slides are posted just before the class but Nelson often likes to use the chalk board to lecture on different concepts The notes often help to answer some of the homework questions which make up the bulk of your grade There is no real need to study the slides before class starts Class lectures tend to be a bit long 80 minutes so make sure to keep focused though Nelson does a pretty good job at keeping things lively and throwing in the odd joke here and there Note that it is a large class 60 students because the material is highly popular Nelson is a good professor and it is offered only once every few years This means that you should try to raise your hand and speak up every once in a while as class participation is a factor of your grade Nelson asks questions to the class a number of times each class so opportunities abound The readings while technically required are not referenced in class or on the homework and thus are not terribly value additive to your experiencei n the course but are still important if youd like to know more about the material There are 4 homework assignments one for every module and they are assigned during the last week of each module and students are given 1 2 weeks to complete them depending on their length These homeworks are long and challenging they often do not have a single correct answer for many of the questions It is critical to scan the literature and cite different papers in order to be able to answer many questions since the problems go above and beyond the class material There is typically 1 major section in each homework dedicated to creating a pharmacokinetic model as such the lectures corresponding to the PK model should be those that you take the most notes on For non CBE students these types of problems are difficult so be prepared to struggle a bit before understanding the concept Make sure to work with others so that 1 you make sure your answers are thorough enough and youve covered your bases and or cited all the important papers and 2 your PK model corresponds to those of others Working with others also helps ease the burden of tackling a long homework by yourself Note that the homeworks are graded very stringently with points taken off at every opportunity That requires students to be conscientious while completing these assignments in addition to going to office hours Office hours are offered 3 times a week and they are opportunities to check whether your answers go in enough detail or to check different facets of the PK model For example a great question to ask for PK models concern the number of assumptions required for a given model Regarding the project proposal and the final paper the most difficult aspect is to complete a thorough enough literature search The paper asks you to take a recent published study and discuss its significance along with a discussion of the disease itself Nelson is a learner at heart and reads copiously in multiple scientific spheres As such she expects her students to do the same The final paper is required to be 6 pages single spaced with a heavy portion of the paper regarding the disease etiology background mechanism of action current treatments etc That requires a lot of background reading so do not expect to be able to complete this deans date assignment the day 2 days before You should also select a paper that is intriguing but also not so incredibly difficult that you cant understand it since a good comprehension is required for you to not only be able to understand it but also evaluate critique it No external resources are necessary for this course As mentioned however significant internet searching for scientific papers is required to be able to complete the homeworks as a literature search is key to performing well This class is very popular given the quality of the teaching the fact its only offered once every few years and that its essentially the only kinda anatomy based class at Princeton The dissection opportunities are also rare at an undergraduate level Because of its popularity its essential to sign up for these courses the minute course sign up begins Though the homeworks are challenging its a really intriguing course in terms of its material especially if youre interested in human diseases and how to combat them so youll enjoy it ",

            "text": "The goal of this course according to the registrar page is to introduce students to analysis and actions required to launch and commercialize a tech company through the use of Harvard Business School cases visits from entrepreneurs and two field assignments This is a pretty accurate assessment of the course actually The course is extremelywell organized and is split up into 4 basic modules the value hypothesis the growthhypothesis financing and finally culture brand in that order The first two modules are prior to the midterm and the latter two wrap up the course Each class involves a Harvard Business School HBS case study involving a certain company and a challenge they faced given that this is an entrepreneurship course most of the cases will involve start ups or young companies You will be expected to read these cases in considerable depth and be ready to answer prep questions that are posted on the syllabus Each class is 100 discussion rarely does Kuenne outright lecture or teach concepts instead challenging students via discourse to come upon insights critical to leading a startup In terms of grading 1 customer segmentation assignment 12 1 midterm paper 25 1 final presentation 33 and in class participation 30 The customer segmentation assignment is a group powerpoint presentation in his office using data offered by the curriculum in order to provide recommendations about how the company can target a customer segment and occurs about 2 weeks before the midterm The midterm paper involves providing a recommendation to a start up The final presentation is a pitch for a start up and is similar to the paper but is a presentation For comments about participation see section II Note that these start ups for the midterm final are REAL startups thatyou have to findon your own The first section involves how companies deliver value That means understanding the business context and the problem a start up is trying to solve how exactly it solves it tailoring the product or service accordingly and considering competition as well as the total addressable market The second section deep dives into how start ups grow MVP testing aligning incentives in the business ecosystem of your company and growing the customer base by critically bridging the chasm from early adopter customer segments to early majority and whats necessary to do so The financing section involves understanding how to get money from venture capital firms and the different terms and agreements that are offered Finally the brand culture module looks into You will learn conceptual frameworks and analytical techniques for evaluating technologies markets and commercialization strategies Additionally you will learn how to attract and motivate the resources needed to start a company e g people corporate partners and venture capital prepare business plans structure relationships refine product market fit and create and grow enterprise value Please note that this course is meant for people who are naturally interested in business entrepreneurship and also love to chat talk argue Every day is like a 40 person precept but with way less pretense So if the material doesnt interest you or you dont like to speak up youll hate this course This section I will talk strictly about the classes and how to prepare each day Next section I will talk about the graded assignments So each class is a discussion except for a single lecture course That means thatYOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP Kuenne works very very hard to ensure he picks on as many different people as possible every single class That means that if you consistently raise your hand chances are you will be called on at least once in the class This isnot a okay I said something Im donegrade though Because 30 of your grade is participation the TA will briefly summarize whatever you said that class and then Kuenne will look at the summary of all the comments said in every class over the entire semester to not only grade your frequency but also your insights This means go for quality not quantity Be original Truly think about what you want to say Its challenging and exciting knowing that you may only get 1 2 chances to speak up in a class so you gotta make em count That being said no ones in business school yet so its not like Kuenne expects each comment to be remarkably insightful Just make it clear that youre doing your best to engage withthe material in a critical way and hell appreciate that In terms of preparation actuallyread the cases Donot skim This meansactually looking at theexhibits too Using the exhibits in your verbal comments will help differentiate you from others And also make a note ofall the numbers stated in the case Those numbers are there for a reason Kuenne will test people to see if they remember the numbers and the corresponding significance  Bonus points if you can consider the challenges of a case and then try to connect the concepts to a previous discussion There are 3 major assignments other than the class discussions segmentation exercise midterm paper and final pitch For the segmentation exercise choose your group early and look critically at the provided excel data Look for different trends and try to make categories It will be difficult to choose between model A and model B thats normal its not just you Try to personify the different segments e g Daily Deals Deborah vs Big Spender Sandra In your pitch keep it to 10 slides and stick to the 10 minute limit For the midterm paper FIND AND REACH OUT TO YOUR START UP EARLY A lot of companies are silent or take time to respond You also have to think critically about what sort of questions to ask schedule the interview schedule a follow up interview if necessary etc Do not expect Kuenne to help you find a start up this is arguably the hardest part Writing the paper is actually not that hard once you have a company and know which questions to ask If the info is sensitive you can sign a class approved NDA and provide it to the startup For the final assignment FIND AND REACH OUT TO YOUR START UP EARLY This can be especially difficult during the latter half of spring when things go crazy The start upcannot be the same start up as your midterm unfortunately The same challenges with this assignment follow from the midterm but remember to now incorporate the new concepts financing brand into yourpresentation Once again stick to the time limit and dont go about 10 12 slides Note that the midterm paper is a solo assignment but the final pitch you can have1 partner you choose whom to partner with All the classroom material is provided through a online harvard courses website which you get a link and an account for during the first class Note that you still have to BUY all the materials online through this website but its easy to buy it all at once since its organized in a module for you by Kuenne It is a bit expensive 120 but because all the materials are online you can split the purchase with 3 4 friends using a common account and thus pay much less while everyone gets access to the material This is consistently one of the highest rated courses in Princeton year after year This is not a mistake Its because the class is intense fun well organized and extremely well taught Kuenne takes great pride in this course so you should put in the requisite effort though compared to a typical engineering class lets face it its not as much work Kuenne is a super nice guy and actively encourages everyone to speak up and respects everyones opinions and knows how to delicately balancing teaching with encouraging discourse ONE CRITICAL THING TO KNOW IS THAT THIS COURSE REQUIRES AN APPLICATION AS HIGH AS 120 STUDENTS CAN APPLY FOR THE 40 AVAILABLE SPOTS So take the application seriously But if you do get in enjoy ",

            "text": "The objectives of this course are very true to its name it serves as a biological introduction to the chaos and clockwork that make up life of Earth It does not go very in depth on each of the topics but rather offers a broad overview into the discipline of biology with an emphasis on evolution and species interactions Topics range from the origin of life on Earth at the beginning of the semester to evolution and speciation climate and climate change and ultimately intra and inter species interactions at the end There are several key themes that Dr Rubenstein and the lab TAs emphasize continually throughout the course mutualism trade offs evolutionary fitness evidence of the past on the present and the propagation of genes via reproduction as an individuals ultimate goal Through this course students are expected to acquire an understanding of and appreciation for the basic biological principles that govern life as we know it and the world around us Students are expected to be able to apply the principles that we learn in lecture to new situations in order to predict or explain biological outcomes Students must be able to compare and contrast the various ideas and strategies covered and identify relationships between units The course is divided first into broad topics such as Origins Evolution and Biosphere Form Function Each lecture within is then focused on a particular subtopic such as Origins of Eukaryotes Evidence of Evolution and Nutrient Cycling While there are certainly distinct units every topic truly ties together and the themes continually reappear in discussions and on exams The course is initially sequential as we discuss the origins and history of life and mass extinctions at the beginning of the semester The subsequent material is no longer chronological but rather grouped by the topics discussed above As the key information is entirely qualitative is is absolutely necessary to discuss the material with peers lab TAs and Dr Rubenstein The material itself is not particularly hard to grasp and understand but it is very easy to miss key aspects or forget important details if you do not understand the themes that Dr Rubenstein has in mind A familiarity or awareness of key biological concepts is helpful in this course but certainly not required Much of the material introduced such as Darwins finches overlaps with AP Biology courses and MOL 214 and will likely be familiar to students who have taken these courses Nonetheless it is certainly not necessary to have taken these courses or have any previous knowledge for this course as everything that we are expected to know is explicitly explained in lecture Prior experience conducting labs and writing reports is not necessary but certainly beneficial as lab is a very large part of the grade and the assessment comes entirely from the reports The main source of information in this course is lecture which is led by Dr Rubenstein When students arrive they pick up a set of slides that Dr Rubenstein will use in lecture While the slides have some information they are certainly not complete nor comprehensive Thus it is the students responsibility to take diligent and thorough notes The original lecture slides are quite difficult to learn from and nearly all of the important information is spoken not written so it is absolutely necessary to go to lecture and take notes so that when it comes time to study you know what was discussed on the day of that lecture but may not be on the slides As mentioned the lecture material is not particularly challenging However there is quite a lot of information that is easy to forget so it is important to keep up from the start A very successful strategy to master the lecture material in this course is to create flashcards each week after lecture with the most important terms definitions and biological examples and to review them cumulatively with the rest of the material each subsequent week This strategy not only helps you to learn the material but also alleviates most of the stress and studying that you need to do when it comes to the exam because you have already internalized the material and should be equipped to discuss it There are two types of assigned reading in this course there is a textbook and several additional books As shown on the syllabus each week has corresponding reading from the textbook and each unit has a book that coincides with it The textbook is certainly not necessary to understand course material however it is a good resource if you want a more thorough description and analysis of a concept mentioned in lecture Likewise the additional books arent essential as everything that you need to know is said in lecture but they are very helpful in providing biological examples and creating a more holistic understanding of the material While there is not system to keep you accountable for the reading the assignments are made very intentionally to correspond to the material that we are learning in class If you read just a couple chapters a night it is quite easy to finish the books that correspond with each unit Furthermore the selected books are really really interesting They are not intended as textbooks but rather read like novels They are meant to be enjoyable readings that reinforce the key principles of life of Earth that are taught in this course The final component of the course are the labs The labs are so key to this course more so than any other course I have ever taken The lab material is entirely integrated into the lectures and exams and vice versa As such it is nearly impossible to succeed in this course without a strong understanding of the labs The lab material will coincide with the lectures in that unit and are meant to provide a more thorough understanding of the concepts and an opportunity to see these concepts in action in the world around us Prior to each lab section students are expected to have read and understood the lab description and procedure During lab students work in groups to complete the various tasks and discuss the key takeaways Following lab students must complete individual write ups and answer questions about the lab These lab reports are a very large portion of the course grade and so it is very important that they are done well Each lab TA has very distinct expectations and so it is important to communicate with your TA and understand these early on The TAs are also an excellent resource as you are completing the write up as they are happy to discuss the labs and answer any questions that you may have which will absolutely help you to do well on the reports In addition to understanding the lab material for the reports it is crucial to understand how it fits into the lecture as the two are very interrelated and the lab material will certainly show up on the exams This course is challenging in that there are very few assessments and so it is incredibly easy to fall behind The only forms of assessment are the midterm and final exams and the various lab reports throughout the semester The examinations require that students not only understand the basic mechanisms and principles that were discussed in lecture and lab but that students are able to compare contrast and apply these to various situations Students must be able to demonstrate not only that they know each principle but that they understand how it works with the other principles and how it relates to the common themes particularly mutualisms tradeoffs and reproduction The exams provide students with a significant amount of choice in what to answer so it becomes more important to understand a few principles very well than to understand all of the principles only at a surface level It is also incredibly important to understand and use biological examples when answering exam questions The books are a great resource for these as are the labs and lectures In preparing for the exams be sure to take advantage of the main idea bullet points at the end of each lecture These are a reflection of what the professor deems most important and should be your points of focus Additionally use the big picture questions at the start of each lecture to guide your thinking and help frame the smaller ideas in context of the larger ones As there are no practice exams available it is good exam preparation to try to answer these big picture questions as they tie together material from different units in a way that is similar to the exams Finally it is important that you dont neglect the labs in your studying as they most definitely appear on the exams in some form This course really does not require a significant amount of external resources It is incredibly important to utilize the lab TAs and attend their office hours to get help on the labs The assigned books while not truly required are helpful in solidifying concepts and providing a larger context for the things we are learning Students can expect to get an introduction to the principles of evolutionary biology and ecology and engage in a significant amount of lab work both conducting experiments and evaluating results and drawing conclusions These skills will certainly be helpful in future lab courses whether in the field of biology or elsewhere The assigned readings offer an introduction to several related fields and careers that may be of interest to you The course is not particularly demanding nor time consuming although you should expect to devote some energy to the labs This course absolutely inspired me and certainly helped strengthen my analytical and critical thinking skills I gained a new appreciation for the world around me and a curiosity for why things are the way that they are ",

            "text": "MOL 460 Diseases in Children Causes Costs and Choicesis an upper level molecular biology seminar The course is taught thematically with each week dedicated to a specific disease such as spinal muscular atrophy or leukemia Professor Notterman introduces each topic by explaining the genotype and phenotype of the disease Each week a few students are assigned to read academic articles pertaining to the disease and present the background and findings from the papers to the class Student presenters also identify discussion questions that expand on the papers Professor Notterman generally facilitates discussions through answering any technical questions and through sharing his experiences from working with patients in the clinic The most valuable parts of the course are undoubtedly the patient visits Professor Notterman invites children affected by particular diseases and their parents These visits lend a humanist lens to the study of childhood diseases beyond understanding the molecular basis for disease presentation patient visits provide insight into the human experience of managing and fighting childhood diseases As this is a seminar course the majority of the learning comes from discussions with fellow students To prepare for lectures SKIM the papers that are being presented It is important to be able to identify the authors argument generally found in the abstract and at least one case example that the author uses to support the central argument Having these pieces of information at the back of your mind will help you follow along with the student presentations Furthermore when Professor Notterman and or the students are presenting you should ask questions whenever a point is not adequately explained Even though MOL 460 is an upper level course students come from all majors and have different biology backgrounds Asking for clarification will not only improve your understanding of the diseasesbut will also contribute favorably to your in class participation grades 30 of final course grade During the discussions you should listen for and note down the different arguments perspectives from fellow students Since the formal assessments are paper based problem sets that ask students to navigate different perspectives and treatment options noting down the various arguments brought up during class discussions will facilitate your efforts completing the assessments Beyond class participation you will be graded on your paper presentation your problem sets take home midterm final group presentation and group paper When preparing for the paper presentation you should not only read the assigned paper but relevant background literature An efficient way of identifying relevant literature is to refer to the citation pages of the assigned paper and read the listed review articles Review articles often clarify technical terms in the assigned paper and provide good background that will be helpful to be share with the class Furthermore becoming an expert on the disease topic that you are presenting on will be helpful on the problem sets and midterm exam Professor Notterman often gives students the option to answer one of several questions I was usually more comfortable tackling questions related to the disease I presented on as I have already done extensive background research for that topic The problem sets and midterm consist of open book written essay questions Some of the questions test your understanding of the biological underpinnings of disease The answers to these questions tend to come directly from Professor Nottermans lectures this is why asking for clarifications on unclear concepts during lectures is particularly important Other questions present medical cases with ethical social economic and moral implications The key to answering these questions is to generate an argument consistent with your perspectives and to support your argument with case examples from readings hence it is a good idea to write down central arguments and supporting cases as you are doing your readings throughout the semester The main learning outcome from the problem sets midterm is to expand your understanding of the biology behind a disease and the patients experiences with thatdisease By completing the assignments you should become more confident in making ethical decisions regarding questions in medicine i e what course of medical treatment is best suited to a specific family with a preterm infant Investing sufficient time around 15 hours problem set to the assignments will also help improve the clarity and logic of your arguments When tackling the final assignment presentation a strategy that worked for my group was to plan extensively Since the topics are fairly broad i e explore nature based healing for breast cancer patients it is useful to generate a focused objective early on in the project i e explore how nature based approaches reduce stress for advanced patients and promotes better disease outcome Create a detailed timeline for what research each group member is responsible for and concrete times where the group meets to compile the research At the end of semester when the group must submit ONE final paper it is good idea for the group to edit the paper together This strategy helps to ensure that the paper is cohesive and unified As mentioned earlier it is important for students to do some background reading in order to extract the most relevant information from the papers assigned The easiest way to locate relevant background articles is to do PubMed searches of review articles that are cited in the reference section of the assigned papers Furthermore it is a good idea to send your presentation a few days in advance to the TA Through reviewing your presentation the TA will often suggest articles or textbook chapters that may help to clarify aspects of your presentation Professor Notterman also immensely enjoys spending time with his students He offers wonderful advice on everything from classroom related work to future career plans Dropping in on his office hours is always a treat Most of the students in the class intend to pursue a career in healthcare i e as physicians or health policy makers The students are also passionate about illuminating persisting issues in the practice of medicine and how the broader social and political environments shape healthcare delivery This course is unique in introducing students to patients and is one of the few opportunities for students to take a clinical course as undergraduates In many ways the course shows students especially wet lab researchers like myself the implications of biomedical research and how we can harness our scientific understanding to further treatment options for children impacted by diseases The course is enlightening and a wonderful opportunity for everyone interested in a biomedical career ",

            "text": "The purpose of the course is to teach you how to do practical software engineering in the real world The fact that this is listed as a Systems departmental in the COS departmental is misleading this is by far the most applied course in the CS department Throughout it you will learn all the steps required to design develop and test a software application The course materials will provide you a basic overview of a broad range of topics including scripting languages web development cloud infrastructure and databases However there is little emphasis on a thorough theoretical treatment of any topic nor do the topics necessarily build on each other in a sequential fashion Rather the main focus of the course revolves around the design project in the second half of the semester in which you form teams and are expected to complete a software project A huge portion of your learning in this course is self driven making this one of the most open ended and creative courses in the COS department While the lectures and course materials will help provide inspiration and a jumping off point you and your team are expected to teach yourselves all the material necessary to get your design application up and running The professor and TAs will be there to provide pointers and check up on your progress but because the scope of possible projects is so wide they will not hold your hand on implementing your project step by step In this sense the course will teach you the fundamental CS skill of learning by doing which is an important skill for anyone looking to go into software engineering The instruction portion of the course is organized around lectures Each lecture or small subset of lectures is designed to give a self contained brief introduction to a general topic They dont build on each other though they are loosely organized around category For instance in the very beginning of the semester the first few lectures are on various forms of scripting languages Afterwards the lectures cover the very basics of iPhone and web programming Towards the middle and end of the semester the emphasis starts shifting more towards cloud infrastructure and networking The content of the lectures relies heavily on present day technological trends the actual technologies used not the theoretical basis for them unlike most other COS courses Therefore the material is subject to change year by year since it is structured around the current technological environment The lectures are by no means comprehensive and you are also not expected to understand all of them The main goal is to jog your curiosity so you can do your own self exploration in the design project that you pursue For instance if your team decides to build an iPhone app as your design project you will most likely not have to use lectures on Awk C or Go That said since your design project must involve some form of managing data it will likely involve networking as well Therefore quite a few of the lectures are probably at least tangentially related so they will be useful starting points of understanding Since the lectures serve mostly as overviews they will by no means contain enough material for you to complete an entire project As mentioned you are supposed to gain a general idea from lecture and the rest of the learning comes from actually working on your design project Given the huge variance in background level among COS majors for some the lectures will provide fresh and new material and for others the lectures will be a repetition of what they already know from their own personal projects Programming AssignmentsDuring the first half of the semester there will be five programming assignments They are intended as basic exercises in various aspects of software development for instance how to write a regex parser for grep and require a mix of Java C and potentially a few other scripting languages awk and Python in my year The bulk of them are not difficult and are on par with COS126 COS217 COS226 assignments They are also most likely not going to be relevant to your design project in the second half of the semester but if nothing else theyre good for sharpening your programming chops they are also worth 30 35 of your grade so do them well Design ProjectThe second half of the semester involves a lengthy design project which is the main highlight of the course and the reason people choose to take this class You will do this in groups of 3 5 people Choose your team wisely Your team will make or break your performance in the class I was in a team of 3 and we had matching personalities and complementary skills I was fairly proficient in backend programming another teammate was proficient in design and the last teammate drove the vision for the project and was proficient in the frontend aspects Moreover we were all relatively diligent which allowed us to set and hit milestones every single week If you have team members who like to procrastinate you need to be very careful of making sure theyre contributing their share to the project Empirically having a bad team not only affects your performance but also affects what you get out of the course as a whole The design project is very open ended The opportunities are endless as long as you follow a few but important constraints The core constraint is that you must build a three tier system consisting of a 1 user interface 2 business logic and 3 data management So your application must have a UI for people to use and some method of storing data The data can either live on your local machine or on a remote server In my experience the bulk of students build networked applications and these types of applications are more related to the types of software you encounter in your everyday life nowadays Besides this constraint though you can do whatever you want Many people build websites with Django Flask node js etc as well as iPhone apps Android apps With the advent of virtual reality augmented reality loads of other cool developments you could really think outside the box and work on something innovative There is a difference between good and bad projects however and theres so many types of options that impressing your instructor is akin to impressing a VC with your seed stage startup So here are some tips as to how to succeed you can choose to combine them as you wish  Build something technologically sophisticated the truth is a majority of CS students will eventually learn how to build a website or mobile app since its not terribly hard to learn You could go above and beyond by solving a big technical problem whether with your product or with your infrastructure that is nontrivial  Build something that has a unique value proposition you could build another calendar todo app but there are millions of them Think carefully about how you offer unique value Youre free to build something that others have worked on before but even then there are ways to stand out  Build something that is useful for the school CodePost is a classic example of a project that came out of 333 and is now used by graders in 126 226 recal io which Im sure youve all used is another example that is now used by all undergraduates for course selection There are many services within Princeton that might need improvement and working on these projects would be a great way to contribute value The design project is self driven The instructor and TAs have little to no influence over the final vision of your project though you will have periodic check ins with the TAs who can provide some guidance and suggestions as to how to proceed This is at once both a very cool and useful thing but can also be enormously scary if youre inexperienced with doing personal projects See the external resources section below for advice on how to best get up to speed The course is more about building up your skills as a software developer which can be practiced both within and outside of the course Therefore the external resources that I found the most helpful are general resources that will help you with general software development  Hackathons go to HackPrinceton In the Fall or Spring  gitPlease learn how to use git before you start your design project with your team It will make collaboration so much easier Create a repository on Github Bitbucket and practice using the tool to work on independent pieces of a project Learning how to use version control tools effectively is vital for any developer  Other helpful websites Stack Overflow for any programming bugs Bootstrap Foundation for general website CSS styling In my experience some students seem to have an unfair advantage because theyve done personal projects such as websites or apps or worked in various internships But you can catch up Learning how to do your design project having had no practical experience might seem daunting but it really isnt that hard to learn and with a little dedication and passion you can get up to speed If you feel like youre behind though you should really try thinking about and implementing possible design project ideas in the beginning of the semester Since the duration of the design project is about 6 weeks that might not be enough time for you to complete a fully satisfactory product with your team so it doesnt hurt to start early In fact you can pick up a lot of these skills before you even take the course For many students the reason they chose to major in CS is because they liked using code as a toolkit to build what they loved and this course helps students explore that aspect Butthis course is by no means the only means to do so and you can develop these skills by simply working on personal projects or going to hackathons before you take the course ",

            "text": "MAT 215 functions as the introductory course for all potential math majors that do not have prior proof based math experience More generally it serves as an introduction to proof based mathematics As a result while in the fall semester the class is full of potential math majors the spring semester has a lot of PHY COS and ECO majors who are considering graduate school or simply want to understand proof based mathematics The class textbook is Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin The class consists of 2 80 minute lectures each week and attendance is crucial since the book itself is very dense There are also 2 evening problem sessions a weekleave room in your schedule to attend at least one of them It is important to attend each classtry not to miss a single one if possible Read the relevant chapter in Rudin before going to class It will make absolutely no sense but then the professor will explain it by drawing going through examples during lecture and you will be able to keep up with lecture Afterwards read through the theorems in Rudin once more and then start the problem set Real Analysis essentially consists of you learning a few theorems a week and then connecting them to previous theorems to solve problems and prove new concepts It is highly conceptual and the results sometimes seem trivial for instance you will prove that x 2 0 for all x other than 0 but the point of the class is for you to learn to use rigorous logic to solve problems This means that when paying attention to class you should focus less on the actual answers and more on the methods way of thinking used to get to those answers The same tricks techniques will come up again on the problem set and on the exams The assignments will take 15 20 hours a week including time to re read Rudin go to office hours and go to the problem sessions The problems there are only 5 6 of them on any given problem set are designed to challenge you so that you can properly wrap your head around a concept As a result they will often be frustrating but do not lose hope There are resources professor pset groups and TAs at your disposal It is super important that you form a good problem set group during the first few weeks of the semester Ideally your partners will be at your level or slightly better so that you can both learn from them and explain things to them which helps you improve as well The exams will be difficult but in reality are easier than the problem sets For instance the Spring 2014 Final had 3 4 problems on it One was a proof that we did in class one was a proof from a homework problem and two were challenging proofs that used techniques that we learned in class but appeared to be completely different To prepare for them memorize every single proof of every single theorem that you learned in the book on the homework and in class Then do as many practice problems as possible focusing on the strategies and not the actual answers If you can solve these practice problems in a reasonable amount of time you have the knowledge to take the exam Your best resources are the professor at office hours and the TAs Leave time in your schedule for as many office hours and TA problem sessions as possible They will help you get past roadblocks in the problem sets and in midterm preparation In order to take advantage of them start the problem sets 1 2 days before going for help In this way you can ask for help with specific challenges instead of asking how do I do this problem You do not need prior proof based math experience as MAT 215 assumes none However you do need to be quantitatively minded and be able to think in a logical manner More importantly only take MAT 215 if you are committed to doing well in the class Block 15 20 hours of time a week for class problem sets office hours etc and you will do well At the end of the day MAT 215 is an incredibly rewarding classit will teach you how to think rigorously and mathematically You will leave the semester with an understanding of the world of math that is conceptual as opposed to computational and far superior to that of your classmates in other Physics COS Econ and ORFE classes If you want to challenge your brain and come away a better learner and a smarter person take MAT 215 ",

            "text": "MOL 340 Fall 2015 Ploss Principedia MOL 340 Molecular and Cellular Immunology This course offers a survey of immunology both on the micro the molecular mechanisms and macro immunity and disease levels The course covers the basics of different immune cell lineages and how these cells and their functions intersect interact which are important for understanding how the immune system can be leverages in treating human disease Professor Ploss really emphasizes how the role of each cell works into the grand scheme of immunity especially since each cell has multiple functions depending on the context The first half of the semester mostly before midterm exam covers each immune cell class in the context of basics of immunity innate vs adaptive immunity the second half covers details about the immune system as a whole e g mucosal immunity failures of the system manipulation of the immune system so that you can recognize how immunologists and physicians can use these principles to better understand the hosts response to disease Be aware that there are a lot of details so each lecture is chock full of information so it can feel very overwhelming I would recommend keeping in mind the broad goal of that cell type and how that fits into the context scenario that is discussed in a later lecture there is some memorization at the beginning but this helps the rest of the course be much more application based Note that you should have a pretty good understanding of the fundamentals of molecular biology e g transcription and splicing cellular components functions so that you can spend more time learning the actual material of the course than the biology mechanisms The lectures meet three times which means that a lot of material is covered during each week Note that Professor Ploss does post the lecture slides on Blackboard so if you miss a lecture you will have the general information but not the details that he gives while talking with the slides The purpose of the lecture is to learn the bulk of the material for the course so this will be the most useful for preparing for the exam The expectation is that youll be able to absorb the information that he gives and then apply it to the presentations that are done during precept see below Use the slides as a guide for taking your notes in class so either print them out beforehand or write on the pdf on your laptop this way you are less worried about writing everything and focused on adding in the additional information that Ploss provides when lecturing The lectures are where Professor Ploss will emphasize the crucial themes or points that will be tested on during the exams so pay attention This is also a good time to jot down some practice questions for yourself based off of the things that he emphasizes repeats which will be very useful to you when youre studying for the exams Many of the lectures come in two or three parts so if that is the case for the week it is helpful to review the previous lectures material before lecture to refresh your memory Precepts for this course operate very differently than for other MOL courses you will not be reviewing basically any of the material covered in lecture so their purpose is to apply the knowledge rather than review or present it again The precepts are structured around student presentations each student will get to pick 2 3 immune diseases that they will present on at some point in the semester Then each precept 2 3 students will present a case study from Case Studies in Immunology A Clinical Companion as an example for understanding immunity The expectations for the presentations are to present the case and incorporate questions for your classmates to answer as you go along Therefore when youre preparing you should come up with questions that link back to lecture or some other topic from MOL courses that is compelling As a non presenting student make sure you keep track of the main point of each case study i e which part of immunity immunology does this case study cover what is going wrong that leads to disease etc Most of the presentations fall on weeks that the lectures cover the background information to understand the cases The assessments for this course fall into two categories quizzes exams and precept presentations The quizzes and exams are the same length and timing 50 minutes therefore you will be tested four times to help incorporate the material throughout the semester The midterm and final are cumulative so definitely review the information from the course previous to that point While there are no practice questions one useful strategy for studying is to breakdown the main themes of the content up to that point e g Weeks 1 and 2 focused on cell types which then came into play in Week 3s lectures on induced innate immunity The first quiz is very representative of the kinds of questions that you will see in the subsequent assessments While the precept presentations i e case studies will not be formally tested on the exams for the most part in the sense that you wont have to give exact names of disease conditions they do help you understand scenarios where the immune system is not working properly which will be a topic on quizzes exams Thus you can use the case studies as examples to test your understanding of cell types and mechanisms Remember that the final exam is short 50 minutes so focus on the themes rather than remembering every little detail covered throughout the course The presentations require that you make a powerpoint to cover the background context of each case from the book and then craft your own questions for the class The goal is to spark discussion from your classmates and also connect it to the things we talked about in lecture Dont feel that you need to emphasize the exact measurement of the test done by physicians e g 1000 dg mL rather frame it as relative amounts e g high blood sugar for a five year old child Make the presentations fun since it can be sort of dry add photos graphics and charts to keep the audience engaged Try looking through the internet for charts and diagrams that present the information in a different way the diagrams from lectures come from the textbook so if you are not following the information in how it was presented by Professor Ploss the book try finding a different visual representation The preceptors are good resources to ask about the expectations for the precept presentations since there is not a formal rubric posted this way you know exactly what you should include and how your presentation should flow to include the information they want in a way that would be interesting to your classmates This class will give you a very comprehensive and broad understanding of the basics of immunology The information can be very helpful if you are planning on doing medicine or immunology research moving forward additionally the skills and material you learn in the course can be helpful for preparing for the MCAT examination although it will definitely not be tested as detailed as you learn in the course This class will also give you the fundamentals that you will need to understand how certain laboratory techniques were developed by leveraging the molecular mechanisms that are covered in MOL214 and in the course lecture It will take some time at the beginning of the semester to solidify your knowledge about cell types and functions but then you just start adding to this knowledge seeing what happens when these cell types are in different contexts so spend time at the beginning and then slowly form a study guide for yourself that will be helpful for every subsequent examination Keep in mind that you will have quite a bit of information to keep track of so take this class strategically i e try not to take this course while taking some of the heavier MOL departmentals like Genetics or Cell Developmental Biology For the presentations you have the flexibility to choose which case studies you will present so make sure you schedule them at convenient times during the semester relative to when assignments in your other courses are due and about diseases conditions that you might be interested in already ",

            "text": "The curriculum for this course is split in two the first half of the semester gives a broad overview of biochemistry and metabolic engineering suitable for any student in the natural sciences or engineering to understand the field This half of the class ends with a standard in class midterm examination The second half of the semester is spent reviewing research articles essentially studying how metabolic engineers and scientists in general approach questions in research To demonstrate understanding of research methodology the final project is a 10 page research proposal This section of the course also includes frequent debates and guest speakers from industry and academia The goal of the course then is twofold First to give students a fundamental understanding of metabolic engineering and second to elucidate the research process through the lens of metabolic engineering The first half of the course is devoted to teaching two main topics firstly the fundamentals of biochemistry glycolysis the TCA cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway among others An example midterm problem testing this content would be filling in the names of the enzymes in a metabolic pathway in order This content is essentially straightforward memorization and is important for the second half of the course If an assigned article talks about replacing enzymes in glycolysis it is very helpful to have a holistic understanding of the process of glycolysis rather than having to look everything up Fortunately there is not too much information to memorize The second major topic is methods in metabolic engineering such as gene knockout strategies laboratory techniques computer simulation methods and some mathematical analysis Understanding how different laboratory techniques work such as western blot qPCR restriction digest etc is very important for reading papers and later for writing your own proposal While this content has more of a math focus it does not require much practice for anyone with a basic calculus background around 104 along with some familiarity with matrices This gives students a good background for the second half of the course which consists primarily of literature review two research papers are assigned for reading each class meeting and every class consists of a discussion of how the paper approaches its research questions the authors logic methodology error analysis strengths and weaknesses and the overall scientific merit of the paper As mentioned in the previous section the main assignments for this course are readings from the scientific literature The course is graded based on the midterm class participation including discussion and debates and the final proposal Thus to do well in the course it is essential to understand good scientific reasoning The best way to develop this is in the classroom discussions about each article Critical reading beforehand will help the authors scientific reasoning including the assumptions and implications that the authors make about their results their error analysis and the strength of their conclusions are all common topics that come up in discussion Learning to read with an eye to these will be helpful in developing your abilities in scientific inquiry which is essential to writing the final proposal In the same vein Prof Brynildsen hosts two debates during the semester in which two teams of students read the same article and argue either for or against its scientific merit and publication in a journal The same theme of critical reading applies here For the final proposal students are required to come up with their own research topic and expand upon their methodology for example engineering E coli to produce a certain pharmaceutical Students will need to understand the metabolic pathways involved and the laboratory techniques to carry out the project Prof Brynildsen meets with all students two or three times during the semester to narrow topics and offer critique at different stages these meetings are very helpful and he is always willing to meet or offer advice at other times Supplementary reading is included on the Blackboard site as well as a few textbooks but a textbook is not particularly useful for the first half of the course except perhaps as a reference none of the material is covered in enough detail to necessitate one For the final project ecocyc org and biocyc org are very useful for learning more about the enzymes and pathways involved in your proposal Web of Science if you Google that term this is the first result is helpful for finding papers it allows you to see the articles cited in a given paper the articles in which it is cited and the impact factor of each journal which gives you an idea of its overall significance This course counts as an elective in the biology track of CBE as well as a 400 level CBE course which is a general requirement for CBE graduation ",

            "text": "The goal of this course is to teach the kinetics of chemical reactions common to chemical engineering processes These include thermodynamic vs kinetic control stoichiometry of reactions the quasi steady state assumption fixed bed catalytic reactors heterogeneous catalysis and different types of reactors e g CSTR vs PFR The bulk of the course concentrates on material and energy balances for chemical reactions There is one midterm one final and nine problem sets along with 10 precepts The organization of this course aligns directly with chapters 2 7 of the course textbook Chemical Reactor Analysis and Design Fundamentals by Rawlings and Ekerdt It is the rare engineering course in which the textbook lies at its heart as the text is extremely well written and essentially serves as a syllabus for topics of the course The sequence of topics in the course match the table of contents of the textbook so it is very easy to follow along with the course topics Ultimately Professor Avalos is very dedicated professor who will actively shape the curriculum depending on his students challenges and comfort with the material He is flexible enough to spend more or less time on certain topics until the students have truly grasped the concept and is very keen to help in his own office hours Above all he is one of the kindest CBE professors who makes it his priority that all students grasp the fundamentals of each topic before proceeding to the next as a result this CBE course while challenging is one of the most manageable courses as long as the required preparation and effort are made This course contains four main aspects lectures precepts problem sets and office hours The lectures are extremely thorough and each step of calculation is shown for clarity Because the topics align with those of the textbook as do lecture examples quite often it is a wise strategy to bring the textbook every day to lecture as the material on the chalkboard can also be followed along within the textbook slight differences in problem solving technique and explanations will then manifest readily Unlike other engineering textbooks this CBE text is compact and small and thus can be carried easily every day Problem sets are the key to consolidating the material in class Office hours are strongly recommended to not only complete the problem sets but also to understand the types of patterns and steps taken to solve a type of question For example for thermodynamic equilibrium problems one must first define eta then set up the ICE table then substitute into the equilibrium K expression etc The assessments very often parallel directly the types of questions provided on the homeworks and thus understanding the calculation steps necessary for each type of problem such as equilibrium material balance energy balance etc will prove useful for the midterm and final Make sure to find out the common procedure one must follow for each of these types of problems because a very similar one will likely show in the assessment and very often the same steps will have to be taken Precepts though sometimes sparsely attended are very helpful as those problems serve as a template to work from for that weeks problem set Thus the solved precept problem can be used as a guide on how to solve that weeks homework the TAs are very dedicated to this portion as well as the office hours and will often go above and beyond to get your questions answered Main strategies have already been discussed The main function of the problem sets is to reinforce the material learned in class via problems that very often are similar to the examples presented in class and precept The exams most likely show problems identical to those in homeworks save a twist or two that is designed to challenge the student As discussed the best strategy would be to understand the common steps or procedure taken to tackle each type of problem finding the concentration of a product in a PFR via material or energy balance finding the value of K using Clausius Clapeyron and ICE tables finding the production rate of a catalytic pellet via the Thiele modulus etc These steps can then be replicated on the assessments for similar problems As discussed once more it is critical for the student to have completed the reading prior to each lecture and to have the book available during lecture in order to follow along better To study for exams redoing the problem sets are helpful as is completing past exams The best study tools once again is to make a sheet of the steps taken of how to solve different types of commonly recurring problems seen in the precepts as well as on the homework The resources provided by the class lectures textbook precepts homeworks and past exams are usually substantive enough to prepare the student well for the class There are 2 separate readings regarding chemical reaction kinetics and heterogeneous catalysis that will be provided to the student It is recommended to complete those readings as the material will be tested even though it is not included within the textbook Furthermore MATLAB may be tested on certain problem sets though they will not appear on the midterm or final exam at least they did not in Spring 2016 Though MATLAB can seem daunting to some the first two precepts are usually dedicated to demonstrating some common techniques in MATLAB that will be helpful for the problem sets furthermore the MATLAB sections are often more interesting as they demonstrate the real world consequences of the reaction kinetics concepts when translated into an industrial setting such as reactor runaway This class is required for CBE concentrators and rarely do students outside of the department take this class However with the correct preparation CBE 441 should be manageable The problem sets can take a little bit of time but they are the main time commitment of this course outside of lecture and reading the textbook This course introduces the basic fundamentals of analyzing chemical reactions from a non molecular perspective analyzing the concentration profile of a product over time demonstrating the effects of reaction temperature and other conditions via mathematics etc It is also taught by a professor who not only works hard to ensure his students grasp the material well but is also dedicated to ensuring no student feels lost or helpless during the course as can sometimes be the case in a fast paced challenging engineering course ",

            "text": "The goal of this course is to teach the theory and role of separation techniques in modern chemical and biological engineering Main topics will include equilibrium vs rate driven processes distillation processes and the McCabe Thiele Diagram and the effects of thermodynamic non idealities when describing separation processes the final portion of the course concentrates on biological separation processes and some introductory biochemistry This course is very sequentially organized it goes through five types of separation processes e g membranes or heat driven separation followed by a shorter unit on biological separations There is a heavy emphasis on distillation and distillation like processes given its importance in chemical engineering There is one midterm closed book closed notes and one final exam open book but no notes There are ten problem sets with one problem set issued over the winter break The challenge of this course comes from the breadth of topics covered and problem sets and lectures become key to a students learning While thermodynamics is also useful to CBE 250 Prof Link thankfully covers most necessary thermodynamics concepts in lecture rather than assuming students knowledge A helpful strategy is to take notes on the problem sets themselves for example which unknowns are commonly targeted for this type of question as the midterm and final exam are very much within the boundaries of knowledge given to the student In fact the challenge with the midterm above all is TIME pressure while the difficulty with the final exam is the sheer breadth of material A final point about this class revolves around its use of Piazza Professor Link prefers Piazza to blackboard and all necessary materials will be posted there homeworks lecture notes syllabus homework solutions previous exams etc On the question board where students can post questions about the problem sets or exam solutions both the TAs and Professor Link will answer questions It is important to note that they do so quickly and thoroughly which demonstrates the staffs particularly Professor Links dedication to the course There are 5 main aspects to the course lectures problem sets office hours reading and exams Regarding lectures it is critical to attend to learn the material yes even the Friday lectures at 9AM It is worth mention that Professor Link is genuinely devoted to teaching his students He expects everyone to show up for his lectures yes even the 9AM on Fridays and also expects students to show for his office hours Remember that he appreciates those who are truly dedicated to learning and grasping the material so if you ask questions in class show improvement on the problem sets and come to office hours for both TAs and the professors then it will translate in the final exam The lectures in addition to teaching you the concepts will provide the proper equations to solve the homework For our year he tried writing lecture notes via a tablet and posting them online it is unclear whether Link will do something similar in the future or simply write notes on the chalkboard as in previous years Though one can rely on Links posted notes taking your own notes will help The problem sets lie at the heart of the course They essentially teach you how the equations youve been taught are used and why the concepts presented are relevant The problem sets directly line up with the concepts learned in class for example if youve been taught about adsorption and stripping in lecture the homework will focus on that While the problem sets start off slightly basic the student should know that they become increasingly difficult particularly the mass transfer and membrane problem sets while the biology based homeworks are particularly long as well The office hours become very useful to solve the problem sets It is best to attempt the problems by yourself and then head to office hours where the TAs will help Professor Link also holds office hours and even tries to hold them at a time that is helpful to students As mentioned he expects students to show to office hours and is dedicated to teaching the material Finally this is one of the rare engineering classes where the textbook will be helpful particularly the biology portion of the class Though the Seader textbook itself can be a bit dense skimming the textbook critical readings portion will be helpful to solve the homeworks An effective strategy is to skim the readings while concentrating on the equations and the examples As mentioned the midterm and final exam are very much in line with the homework problems given in class The main function of the problem sets of the course is to introduce the application of the equations and concepts learned in lecture the main point of the assessments is to test whether these basic concepts have been grasped Very often the examples shown in lecture can be used as a template to help solve some of the homework problems which is another great reason to attend lecture Furthermore the homework problems particularly for topics 5 6 and 7 in Seader and 8 9 and 10 in Harrison require you to look for the relevant equations in the textbook Note that many of these equations will contain either constants that depend on certain conditions of the phenomena like say a coefficient of sorts or contain variables that will require you to look up other equations Furthermore the student must know that having a ruler becomes particularly handy in CBE 250 as straight lines are critical for correct McCabe Thiele diagrams Piazza also becomes very helpful to the student in preparation for assessments Often Link and the TAs will clarify a common mistake or misunderstanding from the homeworks and the ensuing discussion can provide some insight For example past answers have been about the difference between pore length and pore diameter in membranes the assumption regarding to area of a benzene molecule to calculate a monolayer etc As a reminder questions are usually answered within 24 hours on weekdays and often much quicker The problems on the midterm and final exam should look very familiar to those on the problem sets The biggest factor on the midterm seems to be time management rather than the sheer difficulty of the problems themselves Like other classes past midterm and final exams prove helpful to the student and all should be completed before each of the assessments usually 3 4 past copies are provided on Piazza Finally since the final exam is open textbook it is wise for the student to purchase even if used a copy of the Seader textbook This is not the typical engineering course in which one can get by without the textbook It should also be mentioned that regrades on the midterm are sometimes given but points are given back only if there is truly an argument to be made in favor of the student be sure to look at the midterm solutions if that applies to you because points will not be given back arbitrarilyWith this class there are enough resources provided such that external ones should not be necessary The homeworks solutions lecture notes textbook and finally piazza discussions should provide ample study material See III for use of Piazza CBE 250 is required for CBE concentrators and is rarely taken by anyone outside the department While this course is challenging CBE 250 is one of the more manageable CBE courses given the proper preparation and work Though students may not initially expect so the concepts in CBE 250 particularly distillation columns become very key in later CBE courses such as Core Lab and even Design The problem sets do take some time particularly towards the latter third of the course but this course will help appreciate some of the complexities of chemical engineering in industry instead of learning about ChemE on a abstract spectrum as some other classes tend to veer Finally it cannot be stressed

            "text": " The goal of this course is to survey methods of the transport of fluids and energy during different physical phenomena common in chemical engineering These include steady state and transient behavior conservation equations for mass momentum and energy dimensional analysis and mass transfer The semester is divided into three sections during the first students cover the momentum unit followed by an energy unit and finally a mass unit The first two units will conclude with a take home timed open book open notes midterm and the third with a final exam that includes topics from the first two units The course is fast paced with each topic coming on the heels of the previous while the content itself can be challenging The challenge of this course as mentioned is the combination of the pace as well as complexity of the material Utilizing every resource available becomes critical for success Professor Brynildsen is a demanding yet fantastic professor and is genuinely dedicated to ensuring each of his students grasps the material Resources comprise of office hours of both TAs and the professor as well as precepts previous midterms and finals problem sets and lecture notes Brynildsen is also ultimately a fair grader so the student has the security of knowing that hard work translates at the end of the semester Note that many of the skills and concepts picked up in differential equations and physics 103 is reinforced in this course force diagrams breaking up forces and equations on a particle assigning signs to directions translating a physical phenomena into a set of distinct equations Thankfully the content itself will be freshly reviewed but know that many of these skills previously helpful will once again be germane to the course Ultimately students agree that the course contains three main content takeaways 1 constructing a differential mass balance 2 constructing an integral mass balance and 3 understanding and executing dimensional analysis It is recommended that students pay special attention to these topics when they come up as they become key to the course learnings overall  The course contains three morning lectures one precept a week and office hours on 2 3 weekdays In addition there are 2 midterm exams following the momentum and energy units respectively a final exam and weekly problem sets Know that Professor Brynildsen takes special care and attention to the problems given to students they are difficult and unique designed to stick in the students mind long after the course is finished the meatball problem for example is one of the legacies of this course At the heart of this course are the problem sets They are designed to reinforce the examples provided in lecture and then extend those same concepts It is strongly suggested that these problems are briefly attempted by each student individually and then the vast bulk of these problem sets are completed during the office hours by TAs with other students A helpful strategy would be to take NOTES on the problem sets themselves what sort of tips and techniques were critical to find the solution For example it could be final answer is the opposite sign of the worked number because it is the tension on the fluid not the pipe This is because the midterms are designed off the problem sets so knowing how to complete the homework should yield insight on how to perform similar though far from identical exam problems A further tip for homeworks is to attend precepts or rather to look at the precept problem and posted solution when struggling with the homework The precept problems are often quite similar to a problem on the homework and thus can be used as a basis or template for that weeks problem set Regarding the midterms and finals the best strategy would be to complete as many practice exams as possible Start from the most recent year and work backwards This is helpful because ALL of your materials homework precept problems notes textbook even old exams and their solutions will be with you and available during the exam This means that the more you have on hand the more prepared you will be Though Professor Brynildsen crafts wholly new problems each year he does use past problems for inspiration With respect to lecture I strongly recommend not missing a class Each class is a whirlwind and the best way to prepare is to read Prof Brynildsens posted notes BEFORE the class even if it is a skim It is even more helpful to skim and write your questions down on the side of those notes and then come to class and ask those questions Prof Brynildsen also implements his own style of cold calling and picking on people to answer his questions to the class This is assigned randomly and is not meant to intimidate students but rather engage students more effectively during class if you know you might be called on you will likely be paying more attention Finally while the textbook may prove useful to some it is usually a bit too dense to prove relevant for students The set of correlations in the textbook become the most useful during the second unit but otherwise the homeworks past exams and precept problems prove a substantial enough resource to delve into Many helpful strategies have already been discussed above writing notes on problem sets using the precept problems to guide your homework solutions covering as many past exams as possible A few more are outlined below The problem sets and precept problems are designed to reinforce the examples used in class sometimes directly extending them The exam problems are very similar in nature to these problems they present similar physical phenomena and ask for the same solutions e g what is the velocity of the fluid in the x direction of this curved pipe For this reason it is recommended that you use these problem sets to review and learn from prior to an exam and write your notes on the side The questions you should be asking yourself include the following What is the pattern of physical phenomena I can expect for the exam What are the typical final answers they are looking for e g surface tension Navier Stokes velocity heat transfer coefficient Which lectures seem to be repeatedly helpful that I need to be able to pull out easily for the exams Which derivations seem relevant and which can I de prioritize Are there certain tricks like choosing a helpful control volume that can simplify the math for me For the midterms and final exam practice the old ones because these problems are usually reflective of the exam in terms of difficulty level Because all exams are open notes it is helpful to organize your folder similar to CHM 303 and CHM 304 That means have separate sections for problem sets old exams your class notes Brynildsens notes etc Organizing your folder prior to the exam is also a helpful strategy to recall everything that youve learned Finally remember that exams are curved these timed take home midterms may seem especially challenging but have faith that everyone is following the honor code and thus no one is finding it easy One final strategy for office hours utilize office hours led by TAs for the problem sets but it may prove more useful to go to Prof Brynildsens office hours for the lecture material and his reading notes  Given the scope of all provided resources tapping into all the blackboard resources is more than enough to prepare the student to perform well in the course Brynildsens lecture notes are an especially undervalued resource by students struggling to keep up with the material yet are a very helpful frame for each lecture to remember how each concept relates to one another Regarding the use of in class resources please consult sections II and III At the beginning of a course however do know that reviewing basic PHY103 concepts such as a force diagram or spending extra time on dimensional analysis will reap benefits later as the semester progresses  This course is required for concentrators within CBE and rarely do students outside the department take the course However while it is one of the most demanding courses within undergraduate CBE it also provides huge benefits in terms of ways to think about physical phenomena as well as classic problems that students remember far later the meatball problem the dinosaur in a dissolving egg the cytochromes in a plant and more Students will be able to approach physical phenomena with the confidence that they can break down the entire dynamics of the phenomena by analyzing a single unit of it and performing a balance on it and use those results to grasp larger concepts and equations that describe the phenomena as a whole The course helps you appreciate the elegance often present in physical phenomena that can be found on the singular unit level More broadly similar to CHM 304 the course forces students to keep up with the fast paced and challenging material by utilizing all the resources available to them Professor Brynildsen is intensely devoted to ensuring his students grasp the material and students can walk away from the course knowing that they can problem solve on the spot and translate a physical problem into math and then interpret the results to make a meaningful conclusion ",

            "text": "The goal of this course is to learn how science can influence policy initiatives in search of solutions to global climate and environmental problems This objective is well defined by the types of materials from which the course derives meaning Most of the readings assigned are either policy documents memos government regulations etc or scientific articles related to the technical details andprocesses that influence policy The instructor emphasizes the importance of communicating the results from scientific studies to non scientific groups in order to effectively influence policy decisions The course does not follow a sequential order but rather flows from topic to topic e g stratospheric ozone depletion urban pollution etc Each class session seminar or couple of seminars is usually dedicated to studying both the scientific details and policy issues related to these topics with some though limited linearity between topics This is a very discussion led course which distinguishes it from most CEE courses Thus it is advantageous to be cognizant of this format when preparing for class sessions A basic chemistry background is assumed but in general there are little barriers to entry for this course The most important attribute for this course is a willingness to engage with the reading and stimulate thoughtful discussion during class This course is composed of two 80 minute lectures per week Students wereassessed in participation attendance discussion Blackboard posts homework an in class final and a final paper with an associated presentation The course is very much oriented by the discussions in class In order to prepare for class and participate actively in discussion it is important to not only read the material but also engage with it through annotating and thinking of intriguing questions and relationships to other policy or environmental topics Active engagement with the reading will assist in submitting reflections on Blackboard as well as participating in class discussion During class seminar it is useful to keep a record of the discussion through notemaking While writing by hand may be more conducive to memory and recall making notes on a computer might provide a more thorough record of the conversation which students can review after class and study from in preparation for the qualitative portions of the final exam The homework assignments varied in nature from quantitative to qualitative week to week For quantitative methods that students might have trouble with optional precepts were offered These quantitative problems wererelated to the scientific theory behind environmental issues and werenot thoroughly discussed in lecture but were representative of the types of quantitative problemscovered in the in class final exam As previously mentioned the final exam has some qualitative features that require understanding of the general concepts that govern environmental processes and the factors that influence decision making at the science policy interface The quantitative problems require some application of the concepts covered in the homework assignments as well as interpretation of charts and figures discussed during class In studying for exams it is helpful to review the readings and understand how scientific studies influences policymaking including the difficulties related to successful implementation It is also important to understand the basics of the quantitative relationships and attempt to predict how these relationships could be assessed The final paper presentation is disconnected from the other components of the course in that the student gets to decide the topic and knowledge from discussion and homework assignments is not necessarily crucial to producing a good project It may be useful to think about the different weekly topics in brainstorming paper topics and integrate some of the students own fields of interest Being interested in what one is writing about is very helpful to producing both a successful and enriching assignment The optional precepts and office hours are very helpful in understanding and completing the more quantitative assignments In comparison to most engineering courses this course is very discussion based and qualitative Among the students there is a broad range of academic interests from Woody Woo students interested in international sustainable development to Chemistry students that study the scientific theory behind ozone depletion for example This creates a very interdisciplinary environment from which students learn not only from the instructor but from each other This would be an excellent course for any student considering a future path in industry research or government related to the science policy interface The most demanding aspect is devoting to time completing and understanding the reading ",

            "text": "The course has two sections an Italian historical survey of art and literature from the Renaissance to the present and an Italian culture section Each is taught daily for two hours with a ten minute break between the two and the course lasts four weeks Professor Frassica from Princeton teaches the culture unit in which the class discusses social customs and colloquial language and one or two professors from the University of Macerata teach Italian history of art and literature Every week there is an outing to a nearby town that holds special significance to course material Because this course is unique in structure there are no precepts or labs The class dynamic at Princeton that most closely mimics this course is the two 1 5 hour lecture seminars a week in which there is a combination of teachers lecturing and students having the opportunity to speak in class The professors have a very relaxed grading style and no letter grades are distributed until the final report card The main goal of the professors was to encourage cultural fluency of the Princeton students through improvement in both written and oral fluency in Italian and a general knowledge of Italian art and literature There is daily homework in the form of short readings and written responses as well as research and preparation for informal presentations on Italian artists and scholars the following day Daily assignments over the four weeks include reading Italian poetry or short stories contained in a Pequod packet handwriting a one page reflection on an outing or experience in town and editing previous writing assignments that have been corrected and returned by the professor It includes a writing portion in which students must write a short essay about a personal experience instead of literary analysis for example define vocabulary words covered in class and respond to short answer questions about various plot points of the collection of readings for the course and points of significance surrounding the field trips to other towns This requires having memorized learned vocabulary words having fully understood Italian texts and the more abstract skill of being able to express ones thoughts in another language for the essay portion c To prepare for the exam it is useful to review all of the reading completed for the course If one starts a few days in advance it is doable to review the readings If one has taken notes on vocabulary or overarching themes in the margins of the reading reviewing them alone or comparing notes in a group is a very effective strategy to prepare for the exam When reviewing it is important to speak or write in Italian for most of the review because that is the way that one will be asked to express oneself on the exam One can bring a former textbook from ITA 102 in ones suitcase though past students who have brought the textbook do not often use it Instead Google is a great resource to use if one is interested in reviewing Italian grammar rules verb conjugations etc and a lighter thing to carry across an ocean Although the professors would be willing to stay after class to talk to students there are no official office hours A majority of students who take the course are looking to finish their foreign language requirement and a desire to become fluent in Italian is not the first priority Because one lives with fellow Princetonians in the dorm and does not have many opportunities to speak in class those looking to improve oral fluency must take it upon themselves to practice speaking Italian outside of class by speaking with locals in shops or making friends in the dining hall with Italian university students There are also cultural differences in Italian vs American classrooms While American classrooms are often a more collaborative setting with students being asked to participate for a portion of class time and people can snack or chew gum during class Italian professor student dynamics are more formal The structure of class involves the professor lecturing to students with little participation from students except in the form of questions of clarification This course is a very relaxing one to take over the summer because the workload is light It is very exciting and interesting to live in a foreign city for a month as well ",

            "text": "This class is a general survey of topics in environmental geochemistry Topics covered include the origin and formation of elements the evolution of atmospheric terrestrial and water systems material chemistry including ionic substitution in minerals organic and inorganic geochemistry reaction kinetics chemistry of water cycling and transport of nutrients and contaminants in terrestrial andbiological systems The course is organized in units that may eachinclude several topics Most of the unitsare interconnected though the earlier lectures tend to be more isolated in the larger scheme of the course Each unitis covered between 2 3 lectures Basic familiarity with chemistry is required as suggested by the prereqs of AP Chemistry or CHM 201 though specific nuances are explained in class if necessary The course is composed of two 80 minute lectures per week Each topic is covered by 2 3 lectures but one topic may be concluded and another begun in the same 80 min slot There are optional precepts offered at times when Professor Myneni feels that students may need additional background information for topics like organic chemistry for example The precepts follow the same general format as the regular lectures though there is less attendance and more opportunity to ask questions and discuss The lectures are delivered with PowerPoint slides though the slides are usually not text heavy but rather contain figures equations tables etc The material on the slides are supplemented with notes and additional examples and figures on the blackboard This course requires students to actively listen andtake note of key ideas which usually come from what is said or written on the blackboard Professor Myneni is usually good about communicating what the key take aways are but picking up these concepts requires careful listening of what is said in comment of the material on the slides He also pauses at times to ask conceptual questions and active participation in class is helpful in developing an intuition for the concepts covered At the beginning of every unit printed copies of the lecture slides are distributed to the class I found it helpful to take notes on the margins of these print outs so that I could identify which slide Professor Myneni was referencing when he said or wrote something on the board I took note ofeverything that was said or written on the blackboard that I thought could potentially be important and highlighted points thatProfessor Myneni indicated wereparticularly important Professor Mynenidoes not assign the reading until thebeginning of each unit The readings areusually good reference material especially for memorization heavy topics e g rules of ionic substitution if one needs to review the topics that have been or will becovered in lecture The texts areusually very straight forward but technical so it is not necessary to read sections that cover concepts and equations that you are familiar with except for the purpose of necessary review The assignments werecomposed of 3 4problem sets 5 6 quizzes 1 midterm and final both in class and a final group project that included a presentation Collaboration is not allowed on the problem sets In addition there was no TA in the course when I took it which required talking to the professor if I had any questions He was good about making himself available after class or by appointment which was helpful for completing the problem sets or clearing up concepts that were not well understood during lecture Often times there are several correct answers depending on what assumptions aremade to solve the problems so it can behelpfulto check with the professor if the assumptions that you make are reasonable Given that no collaboration is allowed the professor is helpful in giving you as much informationas you may need without leading you directly to the answer The quizzes are short 5 10 mins and just assessbasic concepts covered in each unit There are usually only 1 2 questions that require recall and or application of a concept to an unfamiliar situation Quizzesare often announced one class in advance and itwas useful to reread and rewrite notes from the unit being assessed1 2 daysbefore the quiz The midterm and final followed a similar format in relation to each other several questions broken down into different parts They require some memorization recall but emphasize the application of concepts to unfamiliar problems When studying for exams I found it helpful to review and rewrite all my notes from each unit covered in the exams and also redo some of the problems covered in problem sets or in class examples No past exams were provided for the purposes of studying The final group project is essentially a literature review followed by a presentation The professor distributes a list of possible topics gauges student interest in each topic and forms groups based on which students indicate preferences for whichtopics Research topics often have some connection to specific concepts covered in class but more so explore an application of these concepts in depth It is very helpful to arrange times to talk to the professor about unfamiliar concepts and questions regardingthe assignments after class for example He is usually very helpful and informative and provides more real world examples that enhance understanding of concepts At the conclusion of this course students can expect to have a basic understanding of many geochemical processes in natural environments Students will be able to solve problems with equations as well as predict how geochemical processes will proceed given certain environmental conditions It is worthwhile to note that this this class has a final exam AND final project so it might be heavy in terms of coursework near the end of the semester The topics that I understood the bestand became most interested in were those that I spoke to professor Myneni about after class or otherwise in search of clarification of ideas that were not clear to me initially Additionally the final project is a great opportunity to explore a current field of research in geochemistry especially if youre considering a related field

            "text": "The central goal of this course is to provide you with a thorough knowledge of climate processes and climate history to allow you to have informed and intelligent conversations about the modern issue of global warming There are five units in this course and they are organized thematically The first unit is the longest and it focuses on climate processes in generalatmospheric oceanic and glacial cycles This first unit provides the background necessary for informed discussion in the second unit which delves into modern climate and climate warming The last three units move more quickly the third focuses on ongoing glacial cycles ice ages and interglacial periods which leads into the fourth unit about climate over Earths history All of these first four units culminate in the final synthesis unit about the implications of climate history for future climate as well as modern responses to climate change The description of this course says that it is intended to be accessible to non science majors and this is absolutely true no background knowledge is assumed This class consists of two 80 minute lectures one lab and a reading from the textbook each week Lectures are the heart of the class especially because there are students taking GEO 102A the same course with the same lectures and exams but without the lab component Professor Sigman is a dynamic and animated lecturer and he works to keep students involved he does demonstrations with anything from balloons to beach balls and he frequently has students work on practice problems and answer clicker questions However one challenge is that each lecture covers a lot of material in great detail and at a pretty rapid pace The information in each lecture is cumulativeso if you lose focus you will often miss information necessary to understand the rest of the lecture which makes it hard to become engaged again A good way to grapple with this challenge is to balance between listening and note taking because Professor Sigman posts lecture slides after class each day and these slides are pretty comprehensive it is not necessary to copy down all the text on the slides In fact it can be a detrimentwriting down every word can make it hard to listen and absorb what Professor Sigman is saying It is better to use the slides as guides to organize the information and then to write notes on the information that the lecture slides alone do not explain in a way that youll be able to understand going forward as well as any details that Professor Sigman emphasizes If taken advantage of labs can be a really useful way to solidify understanding of key concepts from lecture The labs themselves are pretty straightforward they are usually simulations demonstrations rather than experiments in which youre actually collecting data or analyzing results Because theyre straightforward it can be easy to go through them somewhat mindlessly But actively questioning whether you understand why youre actually doing the demonstration and how it connects to the core themes and processes of the class pays off both when working on the lab reports and in terms of overall understanding The textbook reading is not as important to the course Professor Sigman is transparent in saying that nothing that is described in the textbook but is not mentioned in lecture will appear on the exams and this is absolutely true The reading can help with understanding but I found it to be more valuable to spend my time reviewing lecture notes slides and making sure that I understood them than putting a lot of time into the textbook reading There are three primary graded components of this class take home open book quizzes on Blackboard lab reports and the midterm and final exam Because the take home quizzes on Blackboard are open book and have no time limit many students were surprised to find that they still could be challenging They primarily involve multiple choice and fill in the blank questions and the thing that makes them challenging is that they often test for details However most of the answers can be found within the slides themselves only occasionally are they based on something that Sigman said in class but is not explicitly mentioned in the slides as long as you are familiar with and understand the slides I found that the key to doing well on these quizzes was 1 being willing to block off a solid chunk of time to take the quizzesif you do them quickly and try to trust your instincts memory you may miss some counterintuitive answers 2 actively listening taking notes in lecture because familiarity with the material allows you to know where to search in the slides for answers and 3 emailing Professor Sigman if there are any questions that confuse yousometimes the language is unclear and Sigman is completely willing to clarify if you just reach out Lab reports for this class are not like typical lab reports you do not need to write up introduction procedures results etc Instead they involve answering 5 synthesis questions that test your understanding of broad underlying concepts from labs and lecture and your ability to apply those concepts to the real world problems These can be challenging primarily if youre having difficulty with a particular concept e g deep ocean circulation because fully understanding the underlying processes is central to being able to answer the questions Another challenge is that sometimes the questions sound open ended but theyre actually looking for a specific answer Both of these challenges can be addressed by working on lab reports early in the week so that if there are any questions you dont understand you can meet with your lab TA If you work early and email or meet with your lab TA with any questions doing well on lab reports is very manageable Finally the largest components of your grade are the midterm and final exams Like the quizzes these are mostly multiple choice and fill in the blank The challenge of these exams is the sheer volume of material that you need to keep track of in general they test recall of information and understanding of processes more than they test application although there are a few questions about application Make sure that you are familiar with all of the information covered on the lecture slidesyou need to be able recognize though not memorize anything that came up in lecture From there it is helpful to make flashcards from the material on the slides and from lecture notes in order to really nail down the key points from each unit Though it was important to have a pretty in depth and detailed comprehension of the material it wasnt necessary to memorize random dates e g different geological time periods and figures Above all its most important to make sure you understand the underlying processes e g energy transport atmospheric circulation ocean circulation glacial cycles in detail Going back over lab reports and talking through processes with a classmate is really helpful for this The one other element that can contribute to your grade in the course is attendance as mentioned previously Professor Sigman incorporates practice problems into lecture At the end of lecture these problems are collected and you receive full credit simply for turning them in Completion of these problems is not normally calculated into your final grade but if youre on the border between two scales it can tip the scale Though she is not technically an external resource Danielle Schmitt is somebody involved in organizing the class but she often goes overlooked by students because she does not have a clear or official teaching role But emailing or meeting with her can be incredibly helpful Professor Sigman is really great to meet with hes always willing to help students but sometimes his brilliance and the depth of his scientific knowledge can make it hard for him to explain concepts in simple ways Danielle is less of a high powered scientist and shes great at breaking things down and explaining processes in simple terms The understanding that you gain in this course is really valuable and relevant to discussions about global warming and environmental issues Almost every day I see some article about climate change or hear some politicians stance on the issue and I feel that I now have the knowledge to mentally fact check these claims There are two branches of this coursethe lab course 102B and the non lab course 102A While both are valuable I found that labs were really helpful in solidifying my understanding My friends who did not take the lab sometimes found it hard to be actively engaged with the material simply because there were no precepts or regular homework assignments forcing them to keep on top of it As a result without the labs giving them the time to think about the core processes they said that it was easy to get a bit lost in the material without fully realizing it until a few days before an exam However if you do elect to take the non lab section be aware of this challenge going in and make sure to review lecture notes regularly put time and thought into the take home quizzes and go to Professor Sigmans office hours ",

            "text": "ECO 310 is an intermediate microeconomics course and the mathematically rigorous version of ECO 300 It is a core course for the economics concentration as well as for the finance certificate and attracts students from a variety of different backgrounds The goal of the course is to provide a more comprehensive and mathematical analysis of basic microeconomics concepts learned in ECO 100 such as utility theory and pricing decisions as well as to introduce several new topics The course is organized into 5 units as follows The first three units covered in the first half of the course make use of calculus and various optimization methods In the second half units four and five look at decision making in situations with incomplete information through logic and statistics ECO 310 consists of two lectures and one precept each week In lecture the professor will generally introduce a new rule topic prove the validity of the assumptions made and then apply the concept to a typical example problem For those less familiar with mathematical and logical proofs the lectures can be hard to follow However while knowing every detail of the proofs is not required for problem sets or exams it is extremely important to come away from lecture with a conceptual understanding of the material More often than not Prof Pesendorfer enjoys assigning problems that involve corner cases or situations in which the general rule formula does not hold This is to emphasize an understanding of the material rather than memorization of a few mathematical formulas or generalizations Before each class lecture notes are posted on Blackboard As Prof Pesendorfer sometimes writes additional equations and numerical examples on the board in lecture an extremely helpful strategy is to print out the lecture notes beforehand so that you can annotate them in lecture On the other hand weekly precepts are reserved for working through more advanced and involved examples These problems are usually similar in difficulty to those on the problem sets and exams Precept is the best time during which to ask any questions about confusing concepts from lecture as working through concrete numerical examples is great preparation for exams There are a total of 10 problem sets each including 6 7 problems as well as an extra credit problem The extra credit problem is much more difficult than the others often extending beyond the scope of the class and does not contribute to ones grade Instead in Fall 2015 the students who performed best across all extra credit problems were invited to have dinner with Prof Pesendorfer at the end of the year The problem set problems tend to be more difficult than the examples discussed in lecture and can be very time consuming Thus creating personal study groups and regularly attending office hours are highly recommended Solutions are posted on Blackboard shortly after the problem sets are turned in Regarding assessments there is one midterm exam and one final exam which is not cumulative As a result the course can be seen as being divided into two parts price theory monopoly and competitive markets are covered on the midterm while only game theory and uncertainty are covered on the final exam The exams are relatively straightforward and usually include one problem for each major topic covered When studying the most important resources are the problem sets and past practice exams which are posted on Blackboard as the exam nears Once again on exams and homework problems take care to notice whether general rules formulas can be applied to the problems as corner cases and exceptions appear quite frequently The required course textbook is Intermediate Microeconomics A Modern Approach by Hal Varian However the textbook is not particularly emphasized Prof Pesendorfer creates his own lecture notes and does not organize the course according to the text Instead the lecture notes are the most important resource while the textbook can be seen more of as a secondary source In addition there is a Piazza forum for the class that is regularly checked Students can ask each other and preceptors about lecture notes general concepts or specific problems from problem sets and practice exams It is important to note that ECO 310 ECO 300 and WWS 300 are all equivalent courses and cannot be taken multiple times for credit For economics concentrators it can be difficult to decide between ECO 300 which is more conceptual and ECO 310 which is more mathematical For those hoping to pursue a graduate degree in economics conduct quantitative research for independent work or go into a more technical field it is highly recommended to take ECO 310 over ECO 300 If you are interested in the finance certificate you must take ECO 310 ECO 310 is a prerequisite for the core finance courses ECO 362 and 363 as well as a recommended course for several other upper level economics courses If you are unsure it is recommended to start out in ECO 310 during shopping period as it is easier switch from ECO 310 to ECO 300 than to switch from ECO 300 to 310 In addition although the only listed prerequisites for the course are ECO 100 and MAT 175 or MAT 201 knowledge of basic statistics is extremely helpful for the unit on uncertainty While statistics is not assumed you will be working with expected values and probability density functions so having that knowledge beforehand will give you more time to focus on other difficulties People who have strong mathematical backgrounds often find the course easier while others find the logic and math in the second half extremely difficult ",

projects outside of class though students often work in groups in precept Both professors hold office hours are approachable before and after lecture and even schedule a meal or two in the dining hall over the course of the semester where they can get to know groups of students better and the conversation does not solely revolve around coursework The professors aim to explore with students how human activities have affected land use agriculture fisheries biodiversity and the use of energy By the end of the course Professor Wilcove and Professor Caylor expect that students are able to think critically about the scientific political economic and social dimensions of these environmental topics being able to use knowledge of a contemporary environmental problem in order to construct social and political solutions They outline three specific goals in their syllabus they want students to have a thorough understanding of environmental issues that will affect human populations within their lifetimes they want students to develop both a scientific and a policy oriented perspective on these issues and thirdly they would like students to understand the risks and tradeoffs associated with each proposed solution to these issues The course is divided into five units land use agriculture fisheries biodiversity and the use of energy The course does not proceed chronologically through time nor does each unit build on the previous they are pretty self contained However aspects of all units will inform how students think about the other units part of the understanding built throughout the course is how interconnected life on Earth is and therefore how complicated environmental problems and solutions are There are practically no hidden demands in the course The reading load is about 30 50 pages of news and or science articles a week The articles are always related to the topics of the lectures that week If a student has taken an environmental studies class prior to this many themes will be familiar Even students with biology and chemistry background will recognize course concepts such as photosynthesis cellular respiration and energy conversion However the professors do not assume that all students are completely familiar with these topics They spend class time explaining these concepts and the exams do not test the specifics of these processes The homework for precept and precept discussion both involve reflection on ones own experience with these topics so whether students have grown up on a farm or in a city all experiences are welcome and important to discussion of policy solutions to environmental issues The more connections one is able to make to their own life and interaction with the environment the easier it will be to understand the material The professors have narrowed their focus enough that they are not rushing the class or cramming in material in order to finish in time by the end of the semester Lectures precepts and readings are all correlated each week Professors emphasize the main points they would like students to come away with in each lecture and preceptors do the same for each precept In order to learn course content attending lecture precept and finishing precept readings are all incredibly helpful because it allows one to access the same course content in a few different ways over the course of a week Students will also be familiar with aspects of almost every course topic just by nature of living and interacting with the environment ie driving eating food using electricity etc Laptops are allowed for taking notes in lecture though they often prove more distracting in general Note taking in lecture is recommended as the lecture slides that are later published on Blackboard contain keywords photos and graphs but not their definition or entire concept related to them so waiting to look at the lecture slides online later will only give students a preliminary understanding of the lectures contents It can be difficult to write down everything the professor is saying in lecture but they will emphasize the main concepts throughout the lecture so that students know what important topics are to remember It is also worth writing down connections professors make to the weekly readings during the lecture as well as connections to former units The professors also do a wrap up of the important concepts from lecture in the last five minutes of class and look ahead to the next lecture Professors will occasionally pose questions to the class that relate to that weeks reading but usually only call on students who have raised their hands to answer There are two assessment aspects of the course weekly precept homework assignments and in class midterm and final exams The precept homework prompts often involve comparing the stances taken by authors of two or three science articles or brainstorming a solution to the described environmental issue asking students to write around 250 words each week to answer the prompt In precept the articles are discussed and students often do a policy making activity in groups or are broken up randomly and asked to informally debate the ideas discussed in the articles Because precept homework is due the same day as the first lecture for that week students are not expected to incorporate parts of lecture into their homework The articles are meant to be read in and of themselves and end up giving a first look at the theme of lectures that week It is worth reviewing the readings before precept though after having attended lectures for the week because one will have more background context for understanding the articles Students are not assumed to be completely familiar with all elements of an environmental issue so grading is often more addressing effort and understanding what the arguments are rather than coming up with the right answer The midterm and final exams are both made up of questions that require short answer responses They cover lecture and reading material and do not ask students for any outside information The synthesis required on the exams of understanding of scientific social political and economic factors in environmental issues is very similar to the analysis completed in precept and for homework assignments For this reason it is important to make sure that one understands precept discussions and homework assignments thoroughly before exam periods For both the midterm and the final exam the professors distribute a study guide with questions that are similar in structure and topic to those that might appear on the final exam As part of precept homework in the weeks leading up to the midterm and final they ask students in the course to submit a question they think could appear on the exam thereby encouraging students to think like a professor and come up with a reasonable question that asks for critical thinking about a certain theme of the course They do not make public the answer key for the study guides so if students have questions about their responses they should feel free to email or speak with their preceptors or professors to make sure they understand the material before the exam It can be helpful to prep for the short answer questions on the midterm and final by attempting to fill out the study guide on ones own without using notes because all exams are closed book and then going through afterward with notes filling in the blanks After having completed this quizzing classmates about answers to their questions can reveal other potential answers to questions Again because of the complicated nature of environmental problems and solutions multiple types of answers can be counted as correct If a student has a keyword but has missed the explanation of its importance in lecture simply Googling the word can often help students find the background knowledge There is no official textbook to the course so various science websites would help struggling students with background The professors and preceptors also make clear that they are readily available by email or office hours if students have questions at any point in the semester The professors make clear throughout the semester that they would like students to actively engage with the course material by bringing their own life experience with environmental issues into their precept discussions and understanding during lecture They also highlight their interest in getting to know students personally as they do not lead any of the precepts so the only opportunity to get to know them is directly before or after class or during office hours They have structured the lecture material homework assignments and exams to be dependent on each other so that if you can follow along with those assignments one does not need to do extra writing reading flashcard making etc outside of class The clarity of the course demands as well as relevance to everyday life makes this course a very engaging and rewarding one for anyone even slightly interested in environmental studies in the context of global affairs and a manageable STN course for those looking to fulfill the requirement ",

            "text": "The purpose of WWS 353 Science and Global Security From Nuclear Weapons to Cyberwarfare has one primary goal to provide students with the basic understanding of the science and technology relevant to important national and global security issues While high school algebra is sufficient mathematical background to take WWS 353 understanding calculus and basic physics will be very helpful The material and the exercises problem sets simulations exercises all relate to the challenge of developing effective policies to manage security risks The major topics covered are nuclear weapons and their proliferation ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons and biosecurity including SEIR climate change big data and AI and Cyberwarfare WWS 353 is typically taken by juniors and seniors as a Science Policy class mandated by the Woodrow Wilson School or as an interesting elective that touches upon many aspects of the relationship between Science and Public Policy WWS 353 is a well balanced course at Princeton with an average of 50 75 students Professor Alexander Glaser a physicist by training and an Assistant Professor who teaches both at the Woodrow Wilson School and in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering teaches it The class is generally taught in Bowl 016 a bowl in Robertson Hall with excellent acoustics and a stadium seating setup There were three preceptors who supplemented Professor Glasers teaching all who brought a unique area of expertise Classes are organized by unit and are held twice a week for 80 minutes and are supplemented by a precept held once a week for 50 minutes The class is rooted in understanding the theory behind what we are studying and are organized by topic For example the units in the Fall of 2016 were 1 Nuclear Weapons 2 Biological Weapons and Biotechnology 3 Energy Climate and Security 4 Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Proliferation 5a Delivery Systems 5b Nuclear Strategy Deterrence and Arms Control 6 Verification and 7 The Future Big Data AI and Cyberwarfare Professor Glaser specializes in nuclear theory and hence a disproportionate amount of time on Nuclear Energy Nuclear Proliferation and Nuclear Warfare To supplement his lack of expertise in other topics Professor Glaser brings in guest lecturers who offer unique and real world expertise to the classroom For example for a lecture on Cyberwarfare Ed Skoudis a computer scientist who specializes in developing simulations on cyber security for the military was brought in to explain the rigor in developing offensive and defensive attacks While the class revolves around a standard PowerPoint lecture the class is based in current events For examples in the Fall of 2016 one lecture studied Irans JCPOA taught by former Ambassador Mousavian and another studied the spread of Ebola The precepts are used to supplement the theory learned in class by learning a variety of different equations and problem solving methods to contextualize the global policymaking in a scientific context and framework For example you will learn how to determine the yield of a nuclear bomb or figure out how fast a disease will spread The problem sets assigned by Professor Glaser were often difficult and complex requiring the need to attend office hours or working in study groups something that is recommended Problem sets are due in class but it is recommended to start them well in advance so that you can take advantage of office hours should you get stuck The advantage to the problem sets is that they really force you to think outside of the box to apply the theory learned in class coupled with the equations you learned in precept Problem sets are only assigned during the first half of the semester The second half of the semester revolves around a team project and presentation which you work on around a topic you are interested Anything is fair game for example my team studied the viability of a leaked super weapon being developed by the Russians There are also weekly blog posts which allow for you to grapple with the readings with your classmates There is a midterm exam and a final exam Professor Glaser and the preceptors worked to make the exams manageable and they were in my opinion easier than the assignments due to their exhaustive review sessions and relatively generous grading The teaching team embraced technology making extensive use of the discussion channel Slack utilizing a course website and assigning multimedia material for assignments There are many supplemental readings which Professor Glaser made available in the syllabus Should you ever have any questions the teaching team is always more than happy to answer them and provide resources on a particular topic While it is an upperclassmen course there were plenty of opportunities to ask for help and Professor Glaser always made it a point to make sure we understood what we were doing and why we were doing Office hours are also a valuable resource and underutilized by the majority of students I found googling difficult concepts and just reading up on them immensely useful and my high school physics textbook helpful when solving the problem sets This is first and foremost a survey course Rather than learn everything about one topic the goal is to study a breadth of material relating science and global security The lectures supplement the assignments and precept which is where in my opinion most of the learning actually takes place The course provides value through its variety of assignments blog posts problem sets projects and readings ",

            "text": "COS 226 is a prerequisite course for the Computer Science major and for the certificate This course will teach you about the most common known algorithms for sorting binary search substring search pattern matching in a text and other algorithms related to graph theory such as shortest path minimum spanning tree cycle identification etc This class will not ask you to come up with your own algorithms expect from during the midterm and the final exam in which case the algorithms you will come up with will be modifications of algorithms you have studied in class You will however be expected to analyze algorithms in terms of the running time vs memory tradeof The class also teaches some of the most important data structures such as symbol table hash table sets queue stack You will also analyze them in terms of which one is the most appropriate for a given task considering running time and memory The goals of the class in an increasing scale can be summarized as LectureAttending lecture is important because understanding how the algorithms work is way easier through an oral description than through a written one The demos during lecture which trace the algorithm are also very important to understand what the algorithm actually does Again tracing an algorithm through the pictures in the book is harder The lectures are very clear mostly the professor reads from the slides so they do not require anything extra other than paying attention It could be helpful to print the slides to follow them on paper and to take notes if you are finding it hard to concentrate To check for the students attendance the lectures also have little quizzes that you answer through an iClicker Although this is ungraded do try to think about the question because this however small interaction with the material being learned will enhance you understanding of the material Preparation for lecture beforehand is not necessary PreceptIn precept you do exercises that relate to the algorithms data structures just learned mostly tracing and to the assignment To make the most of the precept read the assignment beforehand and make sure you have at least a superficial understanding of the steps of an algorithm The exercises will then deepen your understanding of it It is important to engage actively with the exercises rather than waiting for the answer by the preceptor other student because you will both understand and memorize better AssignmentsYou will spend most of the time for this course doing the assignments which take approximately 10 12 hours In the assignment you implement the algorithms data structures you have learned about in lecture You are in a good shape to start the assignment after you have a clear understanding of how the algorithm data structure works after the lecture and precept You can receive a lot of help doing the assignments from lab TA s and office hours of preceptors however it will be more helpful if you do not over rely on these resources Before starting the assignment you will and should have a plan in mind about how you are going to proceed If you are not entirely sure about whether your idea will work expose your idea to a preceptor in office hours It has happened to me that after 2 hours of writing code based on an idea that was not well thought through in the beginning I realized that the idea would not work once I reached one of the functions we had to write Your code will most certainly contain bugs and some of them are quite interesting as to try to identify and resolve them by yourself rather than immediately seek help If you find that you are taking a long time to identify the bug then definitely seek help as it might just be a typing mistake to which your eyes have gotten too accustomed to be able to identify it ExamsThere is a midterm and final exam for the class The final will focus on the second half of the course The exams contain these types of questions Reading the book may not be necessary for the assignments however it is necessary if you want to have a deeper understanding of the algorithms learn how to analyze them and do well in the exams It would thus be ideal to allocate about 1 5 2 hours a week to reading the book Then before the exam reread the parts of the book that are more analytical the ones that discuss the properties of the algorithm rather than how the algorithm works Put down in your cheat sheet the running time and memory usage for each algorithm data structure The last two types of exercises reduction and algorithm design are the hardest ones in the exam The class does not prepare you directly for these types of questions If you want to prepare yourself throughout the course for these types of exercises then a good method is to do the highest level exercises from the study guide that the course provides Otherwise if you are preparing before the exam use the exercises from the past exams It is important to spend a long time thinking about the exercises to come up with your own answers rather than looking at the solutions as soon as you encounter hardship this is the only way to develop your own strategies about how to approach these more creative exercises Blackboard exercisesThis class also has 2 3 Blackboard exercises per lecture due every Sunday night These exercises mostly ask you to do algorithm tracing yes there is a lot of that in this class You have 3 trials and only the best score counts To save yourself time it is better to do the exercises carefully and slowly once rather then do them quickly 3 times Besides doing them carefully also double check before you submit one typo will cost you all of the points of the exercise In case you miss lecture then some YouTube videos with demos of algorithm tracing can help if you find it hard to follow the demos with pictures in the book This course is a prerequisite for the computer science major and certificate To take it you either need COS126 or to be comfortable programming in Java COS126 also gives an introduction to data structures such as stack queue and symbol table This class will explain all of the data structures from the beginning presupposing no knowledge but some familiarity with stack queue and symbol tables would be useful If you are debating between taking this class or COS 217 first my suggestion is that it is easier to continue programming in Java after you have just learned it in COS126 Moreover it is easier to switch to programming in C in COS217 once you know Java very well because the languages will not get muddled in your head However as the COS website will state any order is feasible and does not presuppose knowledge from the other course The course will take about 10 hours for the assignment and 3 hours for Blackboard exercises Time can vary a lot among students but I have found this to be the average time after talking to other students ",

            "text": "This course serves as an introduction to some of the worlds great literature both past and present ancient and modern through the universal theme of exile Works such as The Slave The Odyssey Season of Migration and several others are discussed over the course of the semester progressing from Ancient Greece to Modern America This course also teaches you write a comparative critical essay on a literary theme motif or ideapertinent to the semesters readings Finally a key component of the course rests on participating inclass discussion As a small seminar this class heavily relies on discussion and the sharing of ideas between students and professor As an introductory course this class is very accessible to students withlittle literature and or writing background Many freshmen enroll in this course having not taken their writingseminar and are able to succeed Professor Levy is very good at providing students with the right amount of background information necessary to understand each novel or text and very few times in the semester did students feel overwhelmed or lost about their place in the course Feedback was frequent and helpful and due to the generally small class size Professor Levy gets to know and care about the success of each of her students The class consisted of two 1 5 hour sessions every week with no break in the middle of each section We spent two and a half weeks on a major novel and each session consisted of a discussion of the readings major plot points central themes and character development Students generally posed broader questions about the connections between that sessions reading and that ofanotherunit and discussion often dominated the rest of the session Coming prepared to class was essential in this course Due to the small class size it becamevery evident when a student had not completed the reading or the assignment forthe week In order to fully enjoy and take away anything from the course it is highly recommended to havecompleted the reading for the week and come prepared with key points for discussion Reading is usually around 200 pages a week It is recommended to first read a summary either on SparkNotes or another website prior to reading the assigned pages Thiscan help guide your reading and prevent focusing on non essential details Jot down ideas or impressions that come to you whilst you read as those thoughts will become useful when you discuss the chapters later on in the week Focus on connections with other texts or points made in class as that will be the key focus of the in class discussions In terms of class notes many students took copious notes on their computers Others only jotted down key points It is up to you to decide what method works best for you Keep in mind that your peers will often make good points that you might not remember when it comes to writing your weekly response or midterm papers Participation is central to this course Due to its small class size every individual isexpected to contribute be it in the form of questions or general responses to the text Students who tend to dominate in the participation sector are encouraged to talk and contribute but are also reminded to let those who speak less have their change Students who usually avoid discussion are given a very welcoming and safe environment to step out of their comfort zone and engage in discussion with their peers Professor Levy emphasizes that the class is ours and that our contributions will dictate the direction in which the course goes and ultimately what we will take out from the course This course had three key assessments weekly response papers a midterm paper and a final paper All assessments are take home and we are given ample time and instruction to complete them The weekly response papers 20 serve the purpose of synthesizing the often times busy sessions we have each week Students are expected to flesh out a point or two they found central to their understanding of the weeks material Generally each student talks about something different and we briefly discuss them at the beginning of each week These assignments are informal and graded on a completion basis The midterm paper 25 is an open ended 6 8 page paper through which we can discuss a novel theme or character from any of the texts studied up to that point A rough draft is to be handed in a week before it is due so Professor Levy can give the student feedback and points of improvement The final paper 35 is a more guided 8 10 page essay in which we answer one of six prompts based off of the texts from the second half of the course This paper emphasizes cross textual connections and serves as a synthesis of all of the discussions from the course of the term The rest of the course grade 20 is based on attendance and participation Professor Levy gives students extensive feedback and expectations are always reasonable and clearly communicated She is flexible with student schedules and understanding of extraneous circumstances that might necessitate rearrangement Students are encouraged to make use of the Writing Center when writing their midterm and final assessments Other rescues include SparkNotes and other online summary review websites that aid in guided reading of the various texts covered Some students found audiobooks as a more effective way of processing the novels and several of the texts covered in this course can be found as audiobooks through various university or public libraries This course is very recommended as an engaging and fun way of learning about our worlds diverse and rich literature Students with limited background can very much succeed in this course with a bit of effort and enthusiasm Overall the most time consuming aspect of the course is the reading load which took a couple of hours each weekend However this helps to prepare many younger students the reading load expected of a lot of higher level humanities and social science courses For first semester freshman it also helps expose them to the level of writing expected of Princeton students in a non intimidating and very guided fashion ",

            "text": "This class is great for seniors who need a lighter course load and freshmen who need an easier course ENG 385s emphasis on close reading various kinds of texts makes it extremely valuable for students of all academic departments as this type of analysis and learning to pay attention to detail is necessary in every discipline and every type of independent work If you are an English major dont be turned off by students assumptions about it It is a particularly exciting challenge even for those who are used to close reading This class is as essential as a Milton or Shakespeare class It isnt necessary to PDF the course even if it is outside of your major for it is still fairly easy to succeed in this class ENG 385 does require more time than students like to believe given its subject matter but it is time well spent Most of the books are exciting and the lectures are enjoyable There is never really a wrong time to take this course if it is offered you are interested and you can get in then youll be safe taking it In lecture Professor Semmelhack teaches this course with transparencies and an overhead projector Students are told to print lecture notes before class but they are also available already printed at the entrance to lecture and these lecture notes contain the exact same text as Professor Semmelhacks transparencies Although you might be tempted to take notes on your own paper the lecture notes provided are very helpful especially when Semmelhack rushes through some material it will be difficult to copy down all of the molecular structures on time without the framework he provides on the lecture notes Throughout the course of the lecture Semmelhack will draw molecules and mechanisms or add additional notes which must be copied down onto the lecture notes Since lectures are at 8 30am and last for an hour and twenty minutes many students have difficulty making it to lecture or staying attentive But the lectures are where all of the material was introduced so paying attention and taking careful notes is very important if you wish to do well in the course as it will help you when studying later Precepts are a place to reinforce concepts learned in lecture Some preceptors extensively recap the material and do practice problems others will briefly summarize the material and then offer help as the students work through the precept problem sets in small groups in the remainder of the time Choose a good preceptor for you based on which of these strategies you prefer Semmalhack and the preceptors all offer office hours for additional questions or problems with the material and can help if you are stuck on a certain concept The main textbook used in Fall 2015 was Sorells comprehensive text Organic Chemistry this is also used for CHM 304 and 304B You can purchase a companion edition with the solutions to the in text problems and that is definitely recommended for the purposes of practice and studying However the problems in the textbook are not required or graded You are also asked to purchase a The Organic Chem Lab Survival Manual for better understanding of lab work any edition should be fine but I didnt personally ever find this text useful or necessary There are two ways to succeed in this course First is to do the optional precept problem sets and textbook readings and practice problem sets all along then recap before the test This way has a higher weekly time contribution but you will find yourself less stressed come exam time Second is to pay attention in lecture but not do the weekly precept problem sets or textbook readings and then to study really hard for the exams starting at least a week before This way you have very little time commitment on a weekly basis but have to buckle down at least a week before the exam Both of these options are possible do what you find best Most of the grade in this class comes from the exams There are 3 midterms and then one final not long after the third midterm All of these are open book In Fall 2015 it was possible to drop one of the grades from the first two midterms Also if you did better on the final than you did on the midterms then the final exclusively counted for your grade And if you were one of the lucky few who did astonishingly well on the midterms you were excused from the final All of this is to say Semmelhack does his best to reduce stress levels by making it possible to mess up on an individual test and still do well in the class Exams focused on to testing the concepts learned in lecture by applying general knowledge to certain molecules or reactions to determine the output or to explain why a certain outcome could be expected Generally the exact situation will be different from the examples youd already seen but applying the same principles and patterns will help you to arrive at the right answer There are multiple practice exams uploaded on Blackboard and if you are able to find the time to do all of these or at least look through them all they will prepare you very well Reading the assigned chapters in the textbook to supplement studying the lectures can also be very helpful as can doing additional problems from the back of the chapters in the textbook Also make sure you look through the precept problem sets again before the exam Labs are also a component of the grade You will have lab each week and 3 4 lab reports due throughout the semester Lab reports are straightforward recap and analysis of your results and are looked over once by the TA then you are allowed to make corrections and then submit again Lab material parallels what youve learned in lecture only offers addition examples and experimental proof of the concepts Sometimes the products of your experiments are taken and tested for quality and purity There are also lab questions on every exam that ask you to engage with the material you learned in lab or discuss elements of the procedure These count towards your lab grade There is no required weekly homework but there are problem sets that students start in precept but generally dont have time to finish in precept Finish them when you get back to your dorm or sometime that week They are very helpful and let you keep on top of the material There are also recommended textbook readings and problems Do them if you can ideally as the semester goes on but if you have to do all the readings the week before an exam it is still generally worth it Along with the textbooks provided students generally reach for the Internet in studying or learning to understand concepts These alternate explanations can be extremely helpful in solidifying or explaining concepts that you might have struggled with from Semmelhacks or your preceptors explanations Your fellow classmates can also be a great resource form a study group or talk over the concepts with your friends before the exam Getting fresh perspectives or trying to teach a concept really helps you to remember it Both Semmelhack and preceptors have office hours or you can email them to set up an appointment if you have particularly pressing questions Go to them They are happy to be able to help students Come with questions that you want answered Finally the McGraw Learning Center has both Study Halls where you can work in groups with the help of a tutor and Individual Tutoring for one on one discussion of whatever you are struggling with for students in Orgo Students who excelled in this course in previous years come back to share their knowledge and can be extremely helpful Come with questions or just work on the material but be sure to ask whenever you need help People can make a big deal groaning and complaining bitterly about Orgo Some people actually really love the course however In the end most students will take it because they need it for a requirement either for medical school or a major That being said I took it voluntarily and I know others who did as well so dont shy away from it even if it isnt expressly required for your career path or major it will probably be useful for most science fields CHM 303 is a lot of material but if youve taken chemistry before which you should have before taking this course the fundamentals arent hard to grasp and from there it is just learning to recognize certain types of problem and then apply the concepts youve learned Practice practice practice and make sure you have a fundamental grasp of the concepts when you enter the exam and youll do well ",

            "text": "This is the course description from the ENG 385 syllabus A survey of classic texts written for children from the past 200 years in primarily England and America We will examine the development and range of the genre from early alphabet books to recent young adult fiction We will try to put ourselves in the position of young readers while also studying the works as adult interpreters asking such questions as How do stories written for children reflect and shape the lives of their readers What can childrens literature tell us about the history of reading or of growing up or of the imagination itself In the process we will consider psychological and social questions as well as literary ones This course description is one of the more honest ones of Princetons course offerings As the syllabus suggests the courses goals really are to examine childrens literature from a variety of perspectives social literary historical and psychological This makes the class a great pick for people from different academic backgrounds The course books also vary in genre and length ranging from picture books to large chapter books The course is organized both historically and thematically which still provides an easy to follow track between the different books Additionally the secondary readings come from the same major authors which provides even more of a connection between the different class texts The course assignments 3 papers and 1 final exam all build off of each other The papers start small and become gradually larger and the final exam is comprehensive ENG 385 lends itself to following patterns and making connections throughout the semester No prior background knowledge is needed for the class but it emphasizes close reading and analysis of fictional texts and images This makes it easier for English or other humanities majors However the professor and precepts provide guidance and practice with close reading and the classs focus on social historical and psychological perspectives makes it compatible with students of all academic backgrounds The hardest part about this course is not the professors hidden expectations but other students assumptions about the course Childrens Literature is generally called Kiddie Lit and is known as a class that seniors take senior spring This perpetuates a false idea that the course is easy to fake your way through This is not the case During the class many seniors who entered with these assumptions begin to complain that they actually have to read the books to be able to write the papers or that they actually have to study for the final exam The course is easy because the books are interesting and the professor is lively Also the course structure makes it easy to follow The professor even provides a lesson later in the course on how to study for the final exam The professor and syllabus are very straightforward about the course expectations which are to read the primary course books and pay attention in lecture The professor pretty much hands his students the tools necessary to succeed in this class The most helpful part of this course is the lectures Lecture slides are generally posted right after class on Blackboard but this does not mean that lecture attendance is not important The purpose of the lectures is for students to engage and question the material this is not too difficult considering that the topics are normally interesting and the professor is very energetic and humorous The lectures synthesize all of the information The professor typically begins the class by reminding students of upcoming assignments resources and events He then breaks down the outline for that particular lecture For the rest of the class he presents some historical background and then connects that units primary texts by emphasizing important themes between them He also highlights important ideas and questions from that units secondary readings using those readings to examine the primary text In this way the lectures serve as mini examples on how to close read analyze and make an argument about a book This is especially helpful to those who are not comfortable with close reading For everyone this is a good time to brainstorm paper topics The best way to take notes in these lectures is not to write down everything you see on the powerpoint because that will be posted on Blackboard anyway Also the final exam does not test your memorization of facts but your ability to engage with and analyze material If you take this class and the lecture slides are posted before the class print them out and take notes on them in class If they are not posted until after class use your notes as a time to brainstorm questions and themes For each section of the lecture outline write down the patterns you or the professor notes between different texts Write down some arguments you may want to explore for your papers Lectures are a time to make connections build knowledge and ask questions really The professor truly encourages students to talk back to him ask questions and answer out loud in class This class also has precepts each week As any precept component for any class each preceptor can vary However the key to succeeding in Kiddie Lit precepts is to read the books Come to precept with at least one passage or one question to point out It really is as simple as that Because there are many different perspectives through which to view each book read the books in any way you feel most comfortable with If you prefer to use sticky notes to take notes do so If you prefer to simply read a book without taking notes because its more enjoyable to do so then do it The point is just to read If you fall behind on the secondary readings dont fret The professor gives great summaries of them in lectures If you are a senior in the throws of thesising and come to the point in the semester where you inevitably have to sacrifice something sacrifice a precept before you sacrifice a lecture If you havent read a book and need to sacrifice a class skip a precept If you havent read a book go to that lecture anyway The lectures are so informational that youll get a pretty thorough breakdown of the book which can at least help you to read it faster later Do keep in mind precept absences The course policy is that three unexcused precept absences will result in a failing precept participation grade Depending on whether youre PDFing the course or not plan your absences accordingly The first paper is a short 2 3 page one on alphabet books in which students are asked to close read and analyze picture books using a secondary argument essay The short length makes it easy to put off but try not to put it on the backburnerits a good example of what the rest of the assignments will require View this paper as practice for what is to come When you get your graded paper back use the feedback to inform what you do in your next paper for Paper 2 is just a 5 7 page version of Paper 1 The second paper asks students to close read a book of their choice from the first half of the semester and write on one of the many given prompts If youre not comfortable with close reading yet then you have options for this second paper These options vary from year to year but theres an opportunity to complete a technology assignment instead of the traditional paper The third paper is also a somewhat traditional 5 7 page close reading and analysis similar to Paper 2 If you read the feedback from each paper the assignments will get easier over time The final exam is a closed notes closed book comprehensive but it does not assess your memorization of facts If you have been paying attention in lectures stayed on top of the readings and kept up with connections and patterns your final exam study sessions will be a little smoother If not you can still catch up before exam day The first part of the final is an identification section which asks you to state which book and author the given passages come from The second section asks students to define key terms that come from the courses secondary readings Next there is a section where students show their ability to annotate close read and analyze a passage This is just a smaller version of the papers Finally there is an essay question and students are given a list of prompts ahead of time to look over before the exam Paying attention in lecture and keeping up with the readings are the best ways for students to prepare for the final ahead of time even before the professor gives his lesson on how to study for it Dont be discouraged about the amount of assignments for this class Instead see them as opportunities to gain more knowledge practice for the final and get more points if youre taking the class for a letter grade UTILIZE AUDIOBOOKS Many studentsseniors especiallyget very busy and sacrifice the readings first but this isnt recommended Most of the course books have free audiobooks on YouTube Listen to them at the gym on your walk to class or while eating your meals If you have the hard copy of a book but are having a hard time getting through it follow along with an audiobook You can find many of the books free online as well Check this out before you buy all of the books prior to the start of the semester Even if you have the books in hard copy consider downloading the e books anyway That way you can get reading done wherever you are There are so many students in the class that it does not necessarily matter in what form you read just as long as you read In short just read the books Even if you havent read the books go to lecture This class is great for seniors who need a lighter course load and freshmen who need an easier course ENG 385s emphasis on close reading various kinds of texts makes it extremely valuable for students of all academic departments as this type of analysis and learning to pay attention to detail is necessary in every discipline and every type of independent work If you are an English major dont be turned off by students assumptions about it It is a particularly exciting challenge even for those who are used to close reading This class is as essential as a Milton or Shakespeare class It isnt necessary to PDF the course even if it is outside of your major for it is still fairly easy to succeed in this class ENG 385 does require more time than students like to believe given its subject matter but it is time well spent Most of the books are exciting and the lectures are enjoyable There is never really a wrong time to take this course if it is offered you are interested and you can get in then youll be safe taking it ",

            "text": "ECO 310 is designed as an introduction to true microeconomic theory It is the more mathematical version of the class while ECO 300 is non math track but this just means that ECO 310 problem sets and exams involve longer more involved derivatives and equation solving than in ECO 300 It is helpful to take ECO 100 or AP Microeconomics before taking the class as both of these courses do a good job of explaining the basic concepts consumer choice supply and demand externalities etc that are covered in microeconomic theory However the entire point of 310 is to derive these concepts mathematically from scratch so there is much more math involved than in ECO 100 Having a multivariable calculus background MAT 175 201 203 is very helpful most of the problem sets involve taking partial derivatives There are also some statistical concepts minimal so some knowledge of statistics is useful but certainly not necessary The first half of the course is devoted to the standard consumer choice model indifference curves budget constraints how to derive supply and demand functions and how to find an equilibrium as well as to decision making under uncertainty The second half is more interesting as it applies this framework to many different topics insurance risk externalities and also touches on game theory There are two lectures and one precept each week Morris lectures are highly theoretical and he spends the majority of time walking through highly mathematical proofs For those without a background in proof based math or probability theory these will often be difficult to follow The upside is that no theorem needs to be proved on the exams so students just need to be able to memorize and apply key equations methods The precepts are excellent and are where most of the true learning takes place Preceptors generally present Morris lectures in a more applied light making them easier to understand They also do practice problems that are similar to the ones that are found on problem sets and exams One can essentially get through the entire course simply by reading the lecture sides on Blackboard and paying attention in precept To do extremely well however it probably makes sense to go to lecture as the final exam covered some topics found only in lecture The problem sets are crucial for this classunlike in say a math class it is difficult to find different ways to test students on the same concept in economic theory As a result exam problems are very similar to problem set questions Since there are very few practice exams available before the midterm and final it is important to do the problem sets well have a good p set group They are often very tricky mainly because they require an incredible amount of computation involving multivariable equations this is tedious and it takes a while before the intuition emerges Morris midterm was very straightforward since very few topics are covered in the first half of the course The first few p sets all deal with deriving demand functions and the midterm is naturally similar In contrast the final is difficult because it encompasses the myriad topics covered in the second half of the course and in many cases students have not seen a near identical problem beforehand Therefore it is very important to study both the slides and the precepts do all the problem sets and understand all graphs before the final Grades in the course were relatively homogenous until the midterm but the final did allow for a lot of differentiation At the end of the course about 45 50 of students received A grades This is because the department recognizes that ECO 310 is conceptually and mathematically difficult especially for students without prior background The textbook is absolutely crucial for understanding the concepts in class It is dry but after struggling through it the concepts and problem sets make much more sense The book also has sample problems that are useful as examples for the p sets There is very little useful outside material KhanAcademy and Youtube videos sometimes help with economic intuition but there is not much that can help with the methods other than experience meticulous practice with derivatives and equation solving At the end of the day the course is all about knowing which derivatives to take differentiating properly and solving without making mistakes This course is required for math track economics majors and finance certificate students It gives you a solid foundation of economic theory that will be very helpful in other theory classes ECO 311 ECO 418 as well as in many Econ departmentals In all honesty if you are deciding between ECO 300 and ECO 310 only take 310 if you need it for the finance certificate are considering graduate school in economics or are mathematically oriented i e are comfortable in MAT or ORF classes ECO 300 covers all the same topics but with more of an emphasis on conceptual understanding and less on computation The one other upside of ECO 310 is that the curve is extremely generousthough most economic intuition is lost in the process In terms of timing if you are considering an economics major take ECO 300 or 310 as early as you can preferably sophomore fall or even freshman year This is because micro theory concepts are useful for many other econ courses and you will find yourself at a disadvantage in any other departmentals especially ECO 301 or 311 that you take concurrently or beforehand ",

            "text": "ECO 310 is an intermediate microeconomics course and the mathematically rigorous version of ECO 300 It is a core course for the economics concentration as well as for the finance certificate and attracts students from a variety of different backgrounds The goal of the course is to provide a more comprehensive and mathematical analysis of basic microeconomics concepts learned in ECO 100 such as utility theory and pricing decisions as well as to introduce several new topics The course is organized into 5 units as follows The first three units covered in the first half of the course make use of calculus and various optimization methods In the second half units four and five look at decision making in situations with incomplete information through logic and statistics ECO 310 consists of two lectures and one precept each week In lecture the professor will generally introduce a new rule topic prove the validity of the assumptions made and then apply the concept to a typical example problem For those less familiar with mathematical and logical proofs the lectures can be hard to follow However while knowing every detail of the proofs is not required for problem sets or exams it is extremely important to come away from lecture with a conceptual understanding of the material More often than not Prof Pesendorfer enjoys assigning problems that involve corner cases or situations in which the general rule formula does not hold This is to emphasize an understanding of the material rather than memorization of a few mathematical formulas or generalizations Before each class lecture notes are posted on Blackboard As Prof Pesendorfer sometimes writes additional equations and numerical examples on the board in lecture an extremely helpful strategy is to print out the lecture notes beforehand so that you can annotate them in lecture On the other hand weekly precepts are reserved for working through more advanced and involved examples These problems are usually similar in difficulty to those on the problem sets and exams Precept is the best time during which to ask any questions about confusing concepts from lecture as working through concrete numerical examples is great preparation for exams III Learning For and From Assignments and AssessmentsThere are a total of 10 problem sets each including 6 7 problems as well as an extra credit problem The extra credit problem is much more difficult than the others often extending beyond the scope of the class and does not contribute to ones grade Instead in Fall 2015 the students who performed best across all extra credit problems were invited to have dinner with Prof Pesendorfer at the end of the year The problem set problems tend to be more difficult than the examples discussed in lecture and can be very time consuming Thus creating personal study groups and regularly attending office hours are highly recommended Solutions are posted on Blackboard shortly after the problem sets are turned in Regarding assessments there is one midterm exam and one final exam which is not cumulative As a result the course can be seen as being divided into two parts price theory monopoly and competitive markets are covered on the midterm while only game theory and uncertainty are covered on the final exam The exams are relatively straightforward and usually include one problem for each major topic covered When studying the most important resources are the problem sets and past practice exams which are posted on Blackboard as the exam nears Once again on exams and homework problems take care to notice whether general rules formulas can be applied to the problems as corner cases and exceptions appear quite frequently The required course textbook is Intermediate Microeconomics A Modern Approach by Hal Varian However the textbook is not particularly emphasized Prof Pesendorfer creates his own lecture notes and does not organize the course according to the text Instead the lecture notes are the most important resource while the textbook can be seen more of as a secondary source In addition there is a Piazza forum for the class that is regularly checked Students can ask each other and preceptors about lecture notes general concepts or specific problems from problem sets and practice exams V What Students Should Know About This Course For Purposes Of Course SelectionIt is important to note that ECO 310 ECO 300 and WWS 300 are all equivalent courses and cannot be taken multiple times for credit For economics concentrators it can be difficult to decide between ECO 300 which is more conceptual and ECO 310 which is more mathematical For those hoping to pursue a graduate degree in economics conduct quantitative research for independent work or go into a more technical field it is highly recommended to take ECO 310 over ECO 300 If you are interested in the finance certificate you must take ECO 310 ECO 310 is a prerequisite for the core finance courses ECO 362 and 363 as well as a recommended course for several other upper level economics courses If you are unsure it is recommended to start out in ECO 310 during shopping period as it is easier switch from ECO 310 to ECO 300 than to switch from ECO 300 to 310 In addition although the only listed prerequisites for the course are ECO 100 and MAT 175 or MAT 201 knowledge of basic statistics is extremely helpful for the unit on uncertainty While statistics is not assumed you will be working with expected values and probability density functions so having that knowledge beforehand will give you more time to focus on other difficulties People who have strong mathematical backgrounds often find the course easier while others find the logic and math in the second half extremely difficult ",

            "text": "General Chemistry 201 with Professor Hecht will encourage critical thinking Throughout this course you will be expected to learn the concepts behind atoms molecules ions stoichiometry gases equilibrium enthalpy energy entropy quantum mechanics atomic theory and bonding Many of the concepts learned in class and on p sets will be used in the labs as well Every student will have individual lab times and are expected to follow the protocols given in the lab manual Each student is expected to write the steps of each lab before their designated lab time Ultimately taking what you learn from lab p sets and class will be helpful in studying for exams You will be analyzing these topics in chemistry at a micro level but they are ultimately a part of the macro components of Chemistry For example when we analyze ice floating in water we can see that the hydrogen bonds in the ice form a crystal where they are are further apart from each other However liquid water has its hydrogen bonds more closely together This is the micro level of chemistry where we analyze what is happening to the system based on its atoms and molecules The macro level of this same system of water and ice is the fact that liquid water is denser than ice Keeping these concepts in mind will help you with understanding the larger picture behind p sets readings and labs ExpectationsIt is expected that you should always read the textbook chapters before your lecture This is important to keep in mind because lectures are only so long and cant go into the nitty gritty details like the textbook However since it is assumed that you have read the book this nitty gritty material is fair game for the P sets and exams Strategies How to Take Notes from the Chemistry Textbook In terms of studying efficiently try to review the material by yourself first and then come together with a group of your peers to see their method of thinking about concepts McGraw study halls are a good place to do this however even if you find that you have no time to make it to these sessions it will benefit you to try and gather a group of people who you can meet with outside of glass in general Lastly remember to keep your notes organized This will allow you to retrieve information and prevent extra stress from lost or unorganized notes Chemistry moves quickly ergo your class notes and personal notes need to be organized so you can keep up with the pace of the class The textbook is very thorough but chapters can be on average 50 pages long Do readings a little by little for homework everyday for the appointed lecture Ideally read the majority of the chapter before lecture DO NOT LEAVE READINGS A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE EXAM DONT BE LIKE TASNUVA ORCHI AND OLIVIA PARKER This is one of our biggest regrets in taking this course You can get the most out of lecture by doing the readings Honestly you need to have some idea of whats going on it will help make recognition of concepts easier and engaging To engage yourself take notes for each section of the Chemistry course Also going to the study session hosted by the McGraw Center in Frist is very very helpful Being surrounded by people working on the same material can be very helpful when completing checking p sets and reviewing concepts How to Stay Engaged in Lecture We recommend taking notes on the demos Your attention is vital in recalling the demos that were done in class Briefly sketch and label aspects of the demo This will allow reading demo descriptions found on Blackboard to be easier since they do not have images or detailed information For instance you may see these in class experiments as a time to blow things up but please know WHY the components are blowing up Lastly when studying for exams try to connect the concepts from the demos to the concepts and calculations found in practice problems and key terms in the textbook P SetsThink of how you can complicate the p set more and how you would go about solving Work through the problem on your own first and then work in groups Struggle through the problems Chemistry is not meant to be easy so do not feel discouraged when you have trouble solving the problem Do not rush through p sets and dont just look for the right answer See an answer and know why an answer is right additionally know why an answer is wrong This knew knowledge will come through collaboration with other classmates and their findings from notes and p sets Also try to expose yourself to different ways that you can solve a problem Step by Step Thinking for Solving a P set Problem Step 1 Look at your problem Think of eagle eyes Identify which category and what subcategory it falls under i e When you look at the problem you may think of It looks like the gas law So write down PV nRT as the bare minimum Sometimes equations are connected and encompass multiple ideas so having each one written down is important Step 2 Look at the conditions i e STP and notice how this impacts the equations you can or cannot use Step 3 Really struggle through the problem Dont ask for help immediately No matter how much you want to just look it up or ask someone else please give yourself a good amount of time to really burst your brain on it because who knows you might have an AHAH moment Step 4 Ask yourself How could he as in Professor Hecht complicate this question further Then talk your way through how you would solve the more complex version Step 5 Share what youve found with your peers because they are also a valuable resource and may have another method thought process the same problem How to Study for Exams Please complete challenge problems at the end of the chapter They will serve as ways to complicate the simple concepts found in the book They often combine conceptual ideas and numerous calculations They involve multiple steps and the skills gained from this practice will help with exam problems Practice makes perfect so if takes a long time initially to solve a problem know that you will become faster and more efficient with these problems Thats why its especially important to do as many questions as possible This will allow you to recognize a certain kind of problem on a p set or on an exam Please go to McGraw individual tutoring and study hall earlier in the week if you feel you need help studying This prevents cramming in homework and allows for more time to learn and work independently or study with others Step by Step Thinking for Solving an Exam Problem Labs and Lab Report Lab is something that you will be fine with if you always read through the pre lab thoroughly Never ever attempt to wing it as RPL will constantly remind you TAs also write out explicitly where you have made mistakes within your lab reports as well as how to fix it if you are still confused about the lab contact your TA as soon as possible All in all the lab environment is not overly stressful if you listen to instructions and you will have access to a lot of helpful resources A particularly good resource is the special websites Princeton has created for each individual lab They can be found on Blackboard under the Labs tab and in the experiments folder So use your resources and do your pre lab hopefully with these lab will be an enjoyable time A possible website to help with studying and p sets is KMTchemistry com It is good for getting a series of questions and it is helpful in gauging your general understanding It breaks down categories so you can see what type of of problems fall under a particular topic If youre not already a Pre med student you may notice that many of your peers most certainly are If you are one of those students be sure to keep in mind that you will be in a very high pressure environment no pun intended A lot of students will be focused on getting high grades for Med school purposes so remember even though it is labeled as an introductory course and you may be the type of student who wants to take it to gauge their interest at the end of the day it may not seem like such an introductory level class However please dont let this discourage you from taking the class if you have an interest in taking Chemistry as a pre med student or a non pre med student Also keep in mind that although it is noted that chemistry in high school is not necessary the curriculum is still such that it somewhat assumes that you have taken some sort of Chemistry before If you are a student who has not keep this in mind as well If you havent taken calculus attempt to get familiar with it many of the formulas which will be used can be better understood with a background in derivatives and other important calculus concepts ",

            "text": "ELE 208 is one of the four core electrical engineering courses electrical engineers must take ELE 208B usually taken in the Fall of sophomore year in conjunction with ELE 206 digital logic design It covers basic semiconductor physics and a broad range of semiconductor devices some of which students will fabricate in the labs along with basic fabrication techniques and applications of semiconductor devices in the real world The two sophomore Fall electrical engineering classes complement each other well ELE 208 discusses the physical basis of semiconductor devices such as transistors while ELE 206 combines transistors to build logic gates basic processors and a programmable CPU Most universities teach semiconductor devices in later years as it usually requires significant knowledge of solid state physics However Prof Gmachl Claire teaches this course from a less physics centered perspective requiring only basic physics the foundational engineering physics requirements and an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics which she teaches in the first few weeks of class Claires aim in this course is twofold 1 Depth in the fundamentals of semiconductor devices the quantum mechanics underlying band structure carrier distribution and transport in bulk semiconductors junctions between semiconductors and with metals and the basic function of the field effect transistor 2 Breadth in the variety of semiconductor devices various types of diodes photovoltaic cells transistors and their applications to areas such as biosensing solar cells and digital circuits Since there is no assigned textbook and lectures are not recorded attending lectures is critical for doing well in ELE 208 In the past Claire has also handed out Lindt chocolate truffles in lecture to simulate carrier interactions in semiconductors and to motivate lecture attendance Lectures will alternate between the conventional presentational format and flipped lectures but will consistently be highly interactive To get the most out of each lecture students should come prepared with questions about new material for flipped lectures or previous material This is beneficial for everyone in class since most of the class will be struggling to understand particular details about how the physics works This question and answer format serves to help consolidate a working understanding of the underlying physics or what is happening in lab which is particularly important since the class does not develop the mathematical or physical foundation to derive the answers to intuitive questions The optional precepts are focused on consolidating conceptual understanding students should again come prepared with questions The preceptors will also be willing to help with particular problem set questions and data analysis and writing for the two conference abstracts based on the labs The labs are perhaps one of the highlights of ELE 208 Since the lab sections tend to be very small at most around 8 students there is a lot of time when students can ask questions about lecture material and how it links with what is being done in lab The labs are designed to expose students to what it is like to work in a semiconductor devices lab and are generally very enjoyable without being difficult Because of the nature of device fabrication the TAs will often have to perform additional processing between weeks that cannot be done in the allotted 3 hours Students also learn to take detailed notes in their lab notebooks which will be important for the conference abstracts that are based on the labs The graded assessment in this course consists of problem sets and quizzes beginning Fall 2016 two conference abstracts a midterm exam and a final exam Problem sets are designed to consolidate a working understanding of course material They are generally based on concrete application of the concepts and tools learned in lectures and labs and help prepare for the midterm and final exams the exams can be thought of as a collection of problem set style questions As with any other classes with problem sets work in groups and attend precepts for help with particular ambiguities or questions Claire is generally relatively generous with extensions except for Deans Date but this has led students in previous years to pull heavy all nighters to finish all their procrastinated problem sets before Deans Date To learn from problem sets students should ensure that they truly understand the material so that the homework can become an exercise of application and consolidation rather than a floundering attempt to write something down on a piece of paper Upon receiving feedback if you realize that you do not understand the material or that your understanding was flawed talk to the TAs in precept or ask for office hours so that you can ask questions It is important that students make sure that they have a firm foundational understanding of the fundamental principles For the exams much of the same advice as above still applies To prepare for the exams students should briefly overview the material to see if they have a good functional understanding of the material and then review past problem sets and do as many practice exams as possible Claire prefers to test students on material that they are expected to know from what they have covered in the course The conference abstracts aim to introduce students to scientific writing and conversation in the scientific community Thus in the style of a real conference abstract students are expected to individually write a two page presentation of the results obtained in the lab including a brief abstract and the introduction methods results and discussion sections that are typical to a scientific paper Students are also expected to analyze the data obtained in the lab which are designed in such a way that they can be seen as a simple scientific experimentfor example what thickness of a particular layer of an organic solar cell gives an optimal power conversion efficiency and produce publication quality figures Although this can sound daunting starting at least a week or two before the deadline will spread out the work required and the TAs will hold frequent office hours to help with data analysis and writing The feedback from the first conference abstract will also inform the necessary changes for the second conference abstract There is no assigned textbook for this course since most standard textbooks on semiconductor devices are heavy on the underlying condensed matter physics The Friend Center Library has at least one section dedicated to books covering semiconductor fundamentals and the principles of semiconductor devices including a few good books that are relatively light on the physics and math If you are interested in a more theoretical ground to supplement the concepts taught in class Marius Grundmanns The Physics of Semiconductors and Sze and Ngs Physics of Semiconductor Devices are useful texts These can be used to supplement lecture material but should not replace going to the lectures themselves There are also some very helpful online resources and references ELE 208B is required for electrical engineers in their sophomore year Prospective electrical engineering majors should seriously consider taking this course for a taste of the quality of teaching in the ELE department and the community and camaraderie in the ELE cohort ELE 208A is offered as an STL for non STEM students ",

            "text": "Princeton in Munich GER107 is the fourth and last course of the German Language series The course has two components the language class and the book class The language class takes place at the Goethe Institut every day for three hours with a German instructor The goal of the class is to reach the B2 level of German language which is the intermediate level The other class is in the form of a precept twice a week with a Princeton instructor in my case Professor Jennings The class is in the form of a discussion about a book that the whole class reads and it aims principally to improve literary expression in the German language rather than literary analysis although the latter is still important Another important component of the class is immersion in the German culture To this end the TA s and Professor Jennings organize many paid visits to art and history museums in Munich and the other towns that we visit which focus mainly on German Expressionism and 20th century history Language class takes place every day Monday to Friday for three hours in a Goethe Insitut classroom with a German instructor The class follows a German language textbook The instructor explains some new grammar structure and then the students fill the exercises in the book reading them out loud There are also short texts which the students read aloud and the new words are explained Following the texts there are questions which the students answer The instructor does not explain for a long time most of the time it is the students talking filling the exercises in the book Contribution to the class is very straightforward since this class does not go beyond learning grammar and vocabulary Each of the chapters in the book has a social topic and sometimes there are discussions in the class about these topics but the opinions expressed are related more to personal experiences To prepare for class it is enough to review what was taught that day for about half an hour in the evening The book class takes place twice a week in the afternoon The book has usually been either Kafkas Metamorphosis or Max Frisch Homo Faber At the beginning of the class we went around giving a summary of what had happened in the pages of the book we had read for the week Then there would be discussions about some themes common to the part we had read Professor Jennings would explain the relevance of the themes to the story and a discussion would follow Sometimes we would concentrate on a paragraph and try to unpack it firstly trying to completely understand its language and then its literary importance Professor Jennings would guide the process most of the time Since the last essay is about the book that we read it is good to take note of the passages examined and write down as much as possible from the discussion although it can be hard to do this in German To contribute to the class it is important to read the book slowly and try to understand as many words as possible using the dictionary in the back of the book Since the book is of a higher level of German literature than we had been used to in the previous classes it could happen to completely misunderstand some parts if they were read too fast The amount of work that one puts into this class depends a lot on the goals that one sets for themselves at the beginning in terms of how much German one wants to learn by the end of June The required work is not very substantial a short home work daily for the language class about 70 pages of reading per week a 5 minute presentation and a three page paper about the book at the end of the class The home work for the language class is almost daily but always pretty short Herr Wolf which was my instructor collects the home work and uses all of them to decide on the final grade for his class Sometimes the home work is completing exercises from the book and sometimes it is writing a short essay about a given topic The grading for the essay is based on its grammatical accuracy However short simple sentences will not do To learn and practice more Herr Wolf would rather see you use the grammar structures that you learn in class The essays are a good practice for writing more convoluted sentences which is very hard in German After writing the essay checking it once or twice carefully will help you polish it from mistakes Homo Faber was the book for the last three classes and chances are it will still be read next summer There are many ways one can approach the reading for the class One can read through it fast and still be able to retell what happens in the story and detect major themes If one is interested in expanding their German vocabulary then this book comes with a lot of new words and expressions that are translated either on the short dictionary at the adjacent page or at the end of the book So it is also possible to spend some time writing down new vocabulary and trying to memorize as much as possible or rereading passages that are harder and trying to understand them fully In any case it is valuable to underline and write thoughts about interesting passages since you could use them in your final essay The final essay is three pages long It was about the book that we read during the class but the topic choice was open ended The hardest part is to choose a topic that is limited enough that you can write about it in only three pages What helped me was to think about the passages from the book that had interested me the most that had stuck with me or that I had more notes on Then I tried to come up with a topic that incorporated some of these passages Afterwards the part of choosing the evidence became easier although I did go through the book one more time very quickly The essay does not take a very long time about one or two days but it is good to leave enough time to edit it since there might be many grammatical mistakes that escape when one is thinking a lot more about what to write rather than how to write it The oral presentation is 5 minutes long It is about a topic of interest usually related to Germany or Munich There is no power point presentation included Once you have accumulated all the information you need for the topic and structured it it helps to prepare some sentences in your head about how you are going to express the information After rehearsing once or twice it will be easy to reproduce the presentation in a similar way These might not classify as the usual external resources but the museum visits and theatre goings are perfect for the purpose of this class You can go to the ones organized by the course instructors or independently but if you visit the places advised by them you will learn a lot more about German art and history You will also be able to expand your vocabulary about these topics reading the descriptions in the museum There were two theatre goings during my class and although it was hard to understand even half of what was said reading something on Wikipedia beforehand the experience was still worthwhile This program gives a lot of paid chances to experience German culture so taking as many as possible will enrich your experience in Munich The Goethe Insitut also offers some tours to main sights that you can take advantage of Finally the course asks the students to communicate in German 24 7 the longer and more insistently you respect this rule the better your everyday German will become Students usually take this class to finish the German language sequence and with it the language requirement It is a fairly easier way to complete GER107 and way more fun The class provides the amazing opportunity to live in the country of the language you are learning Since the program is only four weeks and at the beginning of summer it leaves plenty of space to do other things during the summer ",

            "text": "This course offers an introduction to the laws and principles governing physics with a focus on kinematics and thermodynamics The curriculum especially at the beginning of the course starts at a more conceptually basic level and then builds on previous material as the course progresses for example the first weeks progress from 1D Kinematics to 2D Kinematics to Rotational Kinematics so it is important to stay abreast of course material even after the week focused on a particular topic has concluded The goal of this course is not only to provide a background in physics that may be applied to other sciences but also to develop students as scientific thinkers in terms of their ability to make conclusions based on observations interpret results design experiments to test a hypothesis and integrate knowledge to solve problems Classroom instruction consists of three main parts class or precept three times a week in addition to lecture and laboratory components once a week Lectures labs and classes are consistent and focused on the same topic for a given week but they provide different and often complementary approaches to engaging the concept of focus Class Class or precept occurs most frequently throughout the week and as such it serves as one of the main points of becoming familiar with course concepts and working through questions or difficulties students may be experiencing Each of the three classes serves a different function in the course The first class on a topic typically involves working through a handout Handouts provide exercises or small experiments to introduce the concepts relevant to the topic in question The goal of these often interactive worksheets is to allow students to deduce given concepts based on observations and or scientific reasoning rather than simply by reading them in a textbook Therefore students not only gain insight into the scientific process and the interpretation of results in order to make claims about the physical world but they are also able to identify and then hopefully as a result remember the concept for themselves While the handout can seem tedious or confusing on the first attempt for some especially those unaccustomed to less answer directed learning it is important that they try to complete it before the answers are posted later in the week The key can provide additional conceptual clarity and nuance but ultimately the process of working through the concept without these conclusions already provided offers a fuller understanding of concepts needed for succeeding in the course The second class explores applications of the concepts that were identified in the first class and then elaborated in lecture through problem solving exercises The goals of these classes are to provide quantitative exercises that not only help students to develop and apply knowledge but also to prepare them for the types of problems included in written homework The third class features the weekly quiz and also serves as a time for students to ask questions they may have encountered during their reading completion of the problem set or other independent study It essentially solidifies extends and tests knowledge that has been acquired throughout the course of the week Lecture Lecture features a more extended introduction to the weekly topic While not entirely comprehensive because second and third precepts in the weekly cycle often extend and build on content from lecture lectures touch on almost all relevant concepts for the subject while giving more in depth and quantitative examples for a few Demonstrations are another key element of lectures that provide illustrations of physical concepts and highlight interesting applications of relevant topics Demonstrations often begin with a goal similar to that of the handout exercise described above in that Dr Visjnic will often ask questions that require students to draw a conclusion based on their observations of the demo before giving a more in depth explanation of the physical principles illustrated Therefore in addition to being great for visual or kinesthetic if you volunteer to participate in one learning they also once again help students to apply principles to observed realities or phenomena iClicker questions are interspersed throughout the lecture and based on correctness contribute a small percentage to students final grades These questions are designed with the acknowledgement that the concept being tested has in many cases just been learned or observed Therefore while not extremely complex they do serve as a way for both the student and the professor to gauge which concepts students are having some difficulty grasping Ultimately for the student they are a great method and motivation to engage in active learning while in lecture rather than just later when reading the book or studying for the quiz at the conclusion of each week Lab The physics lab is distinct from those that students may encounter in other science courses principally because the exact procedures are often student guided or determined At the beginning of each lab manual students will receive a question that they are meant to test or a hypothesis they are meant to try to disprove given the materials provided for that particular lab The goal of this aspect of laboratories is to develop students as scientific thinkers with the ability to form experimental designs to properly test a particular hypothesis or question While offering this autonomy lab manuals also provide a rough structure in terms of how many experiments ought to be conducted and with what progression Like handouts because of their reliance on inductive reasoning labs can sometimes be initially frustrating or somewhat confusing to students more accustomed to very directed learning However if students fully engage despite these frustrations they ultimately equip them not only with a better understanding of the material but also with how to think through procedure and results scientifically Lab reports are in class write ups that include detailed procedure observations sketches and answers to questions from the manual Overall the lab extends on the purposes and goals of demonstrations by providing hands on application and illustration of the weeks material in addition to concepts like uncertainty analysis Online Assignments Online assignments are due earlier in the week than the written assignment and often fall on the same day as the lecture Because they occur earlier in the sequence they are typically less complex and less involved than written assignments and assessments However it is expected and encouraged that the weeks reading be completed prior to attempting the online assignment Online homework consists of two assignments Is this true and WileyPLUS Is this true provides two statements related to the weeks material that a student must designate as either true or false with an explanation The goal of this assignment is to test and extend conceptual knowledge by asking students to critically consider and apply principles to a novel and often more complex context The explanation or defense of students answers is far more important than whether or not they designated true false correctly because it illustrates their thought process and understanding of a concept in attempting to extend it to the scenario in the question WileyPLUS questions which are multiple choice provide a more quantitative though sometimes conceptual application of material The goal of these questions is to assess comprehension of the reading and to a lesser extent the introductory lecture for a topic Written Assignments Written homework averages about 7 problems that are more involved and complex in nature than those in the online assignment because they are further along in the weeks cycle and are therefore meant to reflect a fuller comprehension of the material Another goal of these assignments beyond quantitative application is to prepare students for the types of problems they will encounter on the weekly quiz The course prepares you to solve these problems using a comprehensive four step strategy Sketch translate simplify diagram represent mathematically solve evaluate Students who adapt to this strategy quickly and utilize it widely often find written homework and assessments more manageable In particular sketches of problems even if not required for a particular question can simplify the process of determining what exactly is being asked and of solving the problem as well Students are allowed and encouraged to work in groups but I recommend at least attempting each of the problems independently first as this will be most helpful when it comes to assessments Quizzes The quiz that concludes each weekly cycle serves to test understanding of material They are short consisting of only a few questions In addition to using the written assignment to prepare for the quizzes I recommend trying the Extra Practice Problems which are taken from another textbook and posted on Blackboard with their solutions Quizzes are designed such that students are expected to earn relatively high scores on if they do the reading and engage with the material throughout the week Exams There is a midterm and a final exam The midterm presents questions that are of a higher level of difficulty than quizzes and written homework because a problem often requires the synthesis of a few different concepts in order to complete it The types of questions given on exams reflect those from assignments including both Is this true and written quantitative exercises but they diverge from these assignments in their goal of assessing a students ability to apply and integrate course knowledge Per the advice of Dr Visjnic the best way to study for an exam is not to reread the book or notes but rather to attempt problems She advises that students attempt a problem a good amount of time before the test so that if they have difficulty they can return to the problem the next day to see if they can get a little farther along in solving it and so on until the problem s is completed instead of merely looking at the solution This technique is particularly helpful because it allows students to glean problem solving strategies or methods rather than just the way to solve one very particular problem The final exam presents questions of a similar nature to the midterm but it is cumulative These external resources were adapted from my experience with a larger group listedhere From this set I found the following most helpful Khan Academy while typically aimed at a slightly younger audience is a great resource for help with specific concepts as its video tutorials are topic specific and provide a clear and understandable overview of principles with some problem solving applications MIT Open Course on Physicsprovides undergraduate level resources Most helpful are the assignments and exams with solutions because beyond the Extra Practice Problems they provide exam level problems for additional practice which is the most effective way to prepare for examinations McGraw Study Sessions offered each Sunday are two pronged One section helps students become more comfortable with the mathematics required for problem solving throughout the course The other offers a review of the topics covered that week with example problems This course while a requirement for many and a fulfillment of a premed prerequisite is also enriching for scientific thinking as a whole if students engage with each element of the course There is less mathematical knowledge or preparation expected and assumed in this course as compared to 103 104 this course does not use calculus but requires algebra and trigonometry Assignments and assessments are designed with the expectation of high scores based on readings and supplementary information provided in class Because of the introductory and clarifying role that class precept plays it is important to select a section during a time when you will be able to engage fully with the material and use the time wisely for clarification and development of problem solving skills ",

            "text": "This course is an introductory survey of topics in environmental engineering The initial topics cover the basics of mass energy balances and thensteer towards mechanisms of pollutant transport and mobilization in the environment as well as reactions at interfacial boundaries The first few lectures build on each other and then start to get less methodologicallyconnected as the semester progresses As with other engineering courses this course is less focused on memorizing equations and emphasizes the importance of applying learned concepts to unfamiliar situations A basic knowledge of calculus is helpful and perhaps some chemistry Most necessary chemistry topics will be reviewed in sufficient depth and you can always ask the professor or TA for clarification they are good about making themselves available Lectures are traditional PowerPoint lectures but the slides are supplemented with blackboard notes The slides are pretty well designed and thorough so there is little need to copy what is on them since they are posted online It is helpful to copy with pen and paper what is written on the board especially when Professor Bourg demonstrates example problems The purpose of lectures is to introduce the theory of problems that you will see in homework Readings were not formally assigned but chapters out of the book were indicated to be good reference material if you wanted to learn more about the equations that are used for example However most equations that are necessary are well explained in lecture slides During this semester there were six problem sets a midterm and a final There was no final project The problem sets are designed to help you apply concepts that you learned in class The nice thing about these is that they tended to start out with more basic problems and developed into more complicated multi step problems For this reason it is easy to learn as you go Lecture notes and slides are good reference materials to review before beginning the problem sets especially the examples that might have been done in class These examples may be similar in content and format to the problems that you might find on the homework Professor Bourg was excellent about making himself available through office hours or informal office visits so be sure to get help from either him or the TA if you have trouble understanding the problems The midterm and final will require you to apply the same concepts that you used in the problem sets but in more complex situations Thus it is crucial that you understand the homework problems very well I found it helpful to redo the problem sets over and over until I could easily do them all not based on memorization but based on familiarity with the methodologies If you become comfortable using the equations and methods with the simpler homework problems you will be better equipped to know when and where to use them on the exams Practice exam problems study guides were assigned before the exams These were not graded or collected at all but the professor did review them in class It is helpful to work through all the problems yourself before the review class sessions so that you can accurately assess how well you know the material that is going to be tested and focus your studying on what you are not so comfortable with Seek out help during office hours from either Professor Bourg or the TA Wikipedia is good for explaining equations definitions You will find that Professor Bourg is an extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic instructor if you go a bit out of your way to get to know him He cares that students understand the material and responds well to those who seek help no matter how basic you think the topics are that you might be having trouble with This is a great course to take if you are interested in any field related to the environment as you will learn about how contaminants enter and are removed from the natural system The math is not too difficult but challenging enough to make the problem solving interesting This course is required for environmental engineering geoengineeing concentraters but can serve as an interesting and not too heavy departmental elective for other STEM majors CBE ORF GEO CHM PHY etc as well as a general elective for those looking to explore the surface of the engineering side of the environment ",

            "text": "The objective of this course is to introduce students to the various mechanisms associated with wastewater treatment technologies Topics include wastewater reaction rates and kinetics BOD and dissolved oxygen analyses of industrial and natural systems treatment plant infrastructure and design etc Though there is a focus on the theory of large scale wastewater treatment processes this course also covers some big picture topics like the environmental implications of treatment technologies and legislative policies that have been associated with mitigating environmental implications At the beginning the topics tend to build on each other with respect to the basis of knowledge Later on in the course topics are connected to earlier topics thematically but with less theoretical basis Lectures are divided into topics though they are not necessarily separated by class sessions i e some topics may be covered half a class period while others may require several Though there are no formal prerequisites it is helpful to have basic knowledge of calculus and chemistry The class sessions are two 80 min blocks per week Rarely the professor will present PowerPoint slides The few slide lectures are uploaded to BlackBoard so dont worry about writing everything down from them Most of the time the lectures will be straight off of the blackboard Much of what is written is helpful information examples equations that will be useful for homework and exam studying Thus it might be advantageous to write everything down that is written on the blackboard Since the professor writes on the blackboard keeping up should be less of a challenge That doesnt mean however that you should zone out from what he is saying Often times he will pause with the blackboard writing to emphasize key points you should make note of these as well At times the meaning of different variables can be confusing since some are reused and similar forms are used for totally different parameters in the same equation e g x and X or k and K If you are confused about what a variable means as it is being written be sure to ask during class of get it cleared up after lecture Otherwise theequations in your notes may be incorrect and thus useless for assignments Often times lecture will begin with a review of the previous lecture so there may be no need to review your notes in great detail in order to prepare for lecture The reading materials are reference materials for review after lecture as you are going over your notes and startingthe homework It is not necessarily required to read the entirety of book chapters posted on BlackBoard you can merely look at the sections that you did not understand well in lecture and review important equations These materials especially for the sake of clarifying equations become very useful for the homework There are three types of assignments in this course problem sets exams and a final project The problem sets are not graded in that they are not assessed on a point by point basis and do not formally count towards your final grade However they are reviewed by the TA and assessed holistically for effort completion and accuracy At the end of the semester the record of your problem set history could be used to boost your grade if you are on the border ofa higher and a lower grade It is likely that if you do not do the assignments with effort you will not be in good shape for the exams as the content is similar The most important preparation for the problem sets is showing up to lecture and taking extensive notes It is also useful to review the book chapters for information as you are working on the assignments At times you will be required to make assumptions without being prompted If you think you need to assume something explain your thought process It is always better to make an assumption than to not do a problem at all because you dont have enough information There are two exams that take up a class period each One is given during midterms and the other right before winter break The best preparation for these exams is not only to make sure you can do the types of problems on the homework but also to understand the equations and their variables that are covered in lecture It is also helpful to understand and review the more qualitative take aways from lecture notes There are no past years exams for preparation so reviewing examples from the homework and lecture is the best method of preparation Again make assumptions as you see fit but state them clearly and explain your basis The final project requires you to use a computational tool provided to simulate the stretch of a river and make recommendations with respect to improving the dissolved oxygen levels You will use some information and equationsmostly covered in the earlier half of the course but most of the legwork will come from your own experimentation and creativity with the model It is important to begin this project early and familiarize yourself with the model so that you have no problem when it comes to devising your own solutions to the given scenario This assignmentis a great opportunity to get a taste for the processes that environmental engineers work with when solving problems and making recommendations for projects in the real world The most important aspect is to use your knowledge of the elementary principles covered in classto be creative with solutions you must understand what types of management processes cause what changes in the system and how they affect other processes In order to successfully come up with and test solutions however you need to give yourself plenty of time Your lecture notes and book chapters can be useful for reviewing topics that are necessary to understand for this assignment Online resources like Wikipedia may be useful for explaining relevant equations if you cannot find them in the texts However the texts are the most useful resources If the chaptersposted on BlackBoard are not sufficient seek out the full copies from other resources like the library As with any STEM class office hours are helpful for making sure you are well equipped to tackle the homework problems This is a challenging but rewarding course that is mainly designed for environmental concentrators in CEE but is also frequently taken by students in other natural sciences geo physics chemistry Thus it can serve as an interesting departmental elective for natural science students that are interested in learning about water management systems The workload and structure is pretty typical of other mid high level engineering courses ",

isotherms and modeling of retardation factors for soils breakthrough curves for aqueous species BOD analysis PCR nitrogen and phosphorus analyses of freshwater samples sampling and characterization of agroundwater aquifer biological sampling of species from a stream etc Students are expected to become familiar with the process of writing scientific lab reports Presentation and project design skills are practiced and assessed through the final project It is expected that students have taken some sort of laboratory course prior to this one as the principles of scientific investigation are reviewed but not covered in depth This course is designed primarily for students on the environmental geoengineering tracks of CEE it is expected that students have some knowledge from introductory environmental engineering courses The course is separated into a weekly precept and lab session The precepts are mainly for orienting the lab sessions and for asking questions There is not much formal lecturing During the precept it is more important to understand the professors descriptions of the laboratory experimentation and analysis techniques rather than writing everything down that he says If anything is unclear about the lab procedure or analysis during precept be sure to ask questions or you will have trouble later on Anything you write down should just be to help you remember key pieces of information that you may need during the lab or for the report e g modifications to the procedure methods of analyses to look into pitfalls etc The main portion of the course is the actual laboratory sessions They are designed to give students hands on experience related to some basic experimentation and sampling methods commonly used in environmental engineering Most will take place in a lab space but a couple will be sampling labs outdoors For those in a lab setting it is important to have come to precept to learn about the objective procedure and methods of analysis for the lab Strategies for success are pretty analogous to those for other lab classes It is helpful to read the lab handout beforehand so that you know what is going and and can get right to work once you show up to lab You shouldread and annotate the entire handout and clear up any confusion with the procedure before starting the lab this will save you a lot of time and prevent you from having to restart after investing significant time in faulty methods For the field labs you must do all of the above in addition to making sure you are properly outfitted for the lab following the professors instructions You must write down all your observations and results during the lab sessions as you will need to include this information in your lab reports Dont worry about making it look extra nice it just needs to be neat and thorough enough so that you have everything down and can understand it later when writing the report Write everything from basic observations preliminary results timestamps of when you did what and where you might have erred in the procedure Between taking notes and beginning your lab report you should merely make sure that you have all the information that you will need for the report This should not consist of aggressively filling in gaps most of the information you need should have been taken down during the lab session There are two types of assignments lab reports 10 and one final project The lab reports are designed to teach you how to analyze data collected during the labs compileresults in the form of graphs and figures and explain your findings shortcomings and future work A great source of stress for many students in lab classes is the prospect of accumulating major point deficits to your grade from wrong results While Professor Jaffe emphasized the importance of being meticulous and careful with lab procedures he was more concerned that we understood the theory behind the experiments and the expectations of what the result should have looked like based on theoretical models rather than actually acquiring exactly what the theoretical values should have been For this reason it is necessary to explain whatyou expected the results to look like and why what assumptions or steps might have caused you to deviate from the expectation and how you could improve the procedure or the experimental model that serves as the basis for experimentation in order to achieve more fruitful results As long as you are careful with your procedure thoroughly explain what you did and didnt do and how that could have affected your results you shouldnt get heavily penalized for not having exactly accurate results In fact accurate results are often impossible to achieve based on factors like yearly variations in the materials used for example If your results are so far off the expected values that they are useless for analysis ask the professor if you can get results from another group If he agrees and you use someone elses data be sure that you mention whose data it is what might have caused your results to be unusable and what you could have done to improve your methodology so as to ensure useableresults The final project assesses your ability to take given data make necessary assumptions design and perform an analysis and make recommendations with respect to the the implementation of a certain environmental protocol The deliverable was a presentation of an environmental impact statement EIS during which students were required to analyze different scenarios of implementation and ultimately recommend the best option This is designed to mimiccommon tasks and presentation methods that environmental engineers must practice in the real world Students were evaluated on a balance ofbreadth and depth of their analysis With respect to your analysis you should weigh several different options consider their implications separately and discuss what the best option is based on the analysis One take away from all assignments is that you will need to make assumptions ALWAYS state your assumptions the grounds for making those assumptions and how those assumptions could have affected your results Online resources like Wikipedia are helpful for explaining equations and analyses techniques that necessary for thereports Im not sure why you would take this class unless you are a concentrator in environmental engineering or geosciences Thats because if you are not a concentrator you will likely not have the background for it and there are much better options workload and intensity to fulfill your STL requirement I found that this class was one of the most enjoyable to takein the realm of CEE and lab classes in general The lab techniques felt relevant and practical for the real world and the outdoor sampling labs were also very enjoyable and insightful with respect to field observations and data collection If you are taking this class it is most likely because you do not have a choice but it may not end up feeling like a course that you were forced to take ",

            "text": "Description of Course Goals CurriculumFourier Analysis is a class about the theory of Fourier Analysis and its application to other mathematical concepts The class will go through all of the steps that lead to the establishment of this theory and prove them rigorously There will be four big modules Fourier sums which is Fourier analysis of 2 periodic functions Fourier transform which is Fourier analysis of decaying functions on the real line Fourier transform of functions on d dimensions Fourier analysis of functions on finite groups Two main theorems will be recurring on each of these modules and most of the module will be concerned proving these two theorems For each module there will also be applications such as using Fourier analysis to solve PDE s and the proof of the Dirichlet theorem which says that in every progression of the from qk b k 1 2 3 q and b coprime there are infinitely many prime numbers Dirichlets theorem takes a chapter to prove and is a very interesting and powerful example of the combination of number theory and Fourier Analysis Besides equipping the students with an in depth knowledge of the theory of Fourier Analysis in this class you learn about some very important pde s such as the wave equation and the heat equation and develop skills that will help you in other analysis classes II Learning From Classroom InstructionProf Ionescu gives very detailed proofs in his lectures He never talks over parts of the proof but writes everything on the board This type of lecturing makes it possible to take very detailed notes and to understand almost all of the material in class or after reading the notes During class he asks for student participation mostly by asking questions about proofs we have done before Therefore a good practice is to read some of your previous notes before lecture as it will help both the memorization of the material and class participation III Learning For and From Assignments and AssessmentsThis class has six problem sets a midterm and a final exam Prof Ionescu only assigned 6 problem sets but they were longer than problem sets for other math classes and we had about 1 week and a half to complete each It would be very subjective to say how hard students find these problem sets but they do take longer than problem sets for any other math class Working in groups can reduce the time spent on each problem set Prof Ionescu is also very helpful in office hours Although long the problems assigned are very helpful to the understanding of the material and provide good practice in problem solving In some of them you even develop a small theory of its own Prof Ionescu described the midterm as easier than the problem sets and that was indeed the case Differently from most math classes the midterm was more of a measure of how well you knew the theory and required less creativity in solving the problems than the psets One cheat sheet was allowed however many students did not rely on it that much the midterm has a short time so knowing the theory on the top of your head is important To study for the midterm besides understanding all of the theory one needs to be able to reproduce on the top of their head the main theorems There might not be time to practice with exercises for the midterm however because of how Prof Ionescu wrote the exam knowing the theory would be enough Differently from the midterm the final is about the same level of hardship as the problem sets so it requires more creativity when solving problems It also has about two or three proofs from the textbook Firstly the proofs from the book were the proofs of very important theorems so there is no need to worry about learning each single proof That said it is good to know the two or three most important steps of each proof since you could use those moves when solving other problems It is especially useful to spend time practicing problems from the book that were not assigned on the problem sets since most of the points on the exam were for solving problems that we had not seen before IV External ResourcesThe textbook written by Professor Stein provides everything that you need to know about the class and more V What Students Should Know About This Course For Purposes Of Course SelectionIt should be noted that this class will not include real world applications of Fourier Analysis but only applications to other mathematical concepts There is an ELE class that teaches the more tangible applications if that is what you are looking for This class can be used as a departmental to fulfill the Real Analysis requirement for math students ",

            "text": "Description of Course Goals CurriculumThis class is organized in terms of the common explanations for war international anarchy economic domestic politics terrorism nationalism technology Each cause is accompanied with a historical case study a war for which this one explanation is most appropriate or evident Lectures explain in detail the historical events and situations that lead to the beginning of the war the period of the war itself is not explained in so much detail The lectures also include some theoretical background for the cause of war under examination Although each war is explained in the light of one cause the bigger aim of the class is to be able to evaluate how well all of these different causes explain all of the wars under examination The hidden goal for examining these historical cases and their causes is to be able to project what is learnt to present future cases of conflict and think of solutions that avoid starting another war Some of the case studies of the class are The Peloponnesian War World War I II Cuban Missile Crisis 6 day war Gulf War ex Yugoslavia Wars II Learning From Classroom InstructionNote taking is essential for this class Lectures provide the most crucial information for the class and they are a shortened summarized version for a lot of the assigned reading They also provide about 80 of what you need to know for the exams Professor Bass talks fast and there is a lot of detail in his explanations so a good note taking strategy is crucial some McGraw workshop about note taking maybe Make sure to put down all the historical facts and dates and bullet point versions of the theoretical parts of the lecture Professor Bass writes some key words on the board before the lecture so arrive to class about 2 minutes early to write them down you will have to explain a lot of these key words on the exams You can also compare notes with some classmate after lecture to enrich your notes There is no model of how precepts look like because many times they are left to the hands of the students Discussions about current affairs are common Sometimes some important reading are discussed like Kant and Guns of August Other times material from the lecture is reinforced when Prof Bass thinks it is necessary Hence to prepare for precept you need to complete the readings and read the New York Times III Learning For and From Assignments and AssessmentsThis class includes a midterm exam a final exam a 12 15 page paper and a 2 3 page reflection after reading a book about a war experience It has about 200 pages of reading per week and you are also required to read the International section of the New York Times Both the midterm and the exam involve key word questions where you explain what you know about a term The key words come from lectures current affairs i e the New York Times and the readings but the latter less so To prepare for this part of the exam go through each key word that Prof Bass wrote on the board and make sure you know how to explain it in 3 4 sentences As for the current affairs questions do not worry the questions will be about the main foreign affairs of the semester and if you have read the New York times regularly you will have seen at least five to ten articles about these events From the readings the key terms come from the more theoretical readings not the historical ones You are always asked about important terms related to the theory never about obscure ones The midterm also involves short questions again from the readings the lectures and New York Times whose answer is a little less factual then the key terms ones and more evaluative To prepare for these ones go through the more evaluative parts of the lectures and make your own short analysis about how all of the theories and the wars you have learnt about in the class fit together Finally we were asked for some names of presidents and prime ministers of countries important to the state of international affairs this caught a lot of us of guard The final exam involves the same types of questions as the midterm but this time from only the second half of the course In the final exam you also have to write two long essays The essay questions were more theoretical and we were asked to argue pro against the essay prompt using 3 of the wars we had learned about in lecture For the essay a good mastery of the historical facts related to the wars was needed Afterwards what helped to prepare was to think about all the big war related questions that we encountered in the class and think about the arguments one could make to answer each question the wars we studied that were most appropriate to answer the question and some current conflicts that were appropriate to the question This essay was due a week after fall break and I did use fall break to write it To write the paper you choose a war that is not on the syllabi and argue what you consider to be the main cause s for this war The paper requires a lot of historical background and historical analysis about 70 of the paper and the rest is more theoretical It does require extensive research but it is also a very rewarding experience The class has about 200 pages of reading There is always a historical source which describes the war under study in much more detail than the lecture There is also always a source that describes the main theory under study for the week The rest are sources that combine both theoretical and historical analysis It might be frustrating to notice that the precepts do not focus solely on the readings Sometimes in precept you are only discussing about current affairs and sometimes the information from the lecture is enough for the discussion Moreover a big part of the exam focuses on information from the lecture and NY Times However the readings compliment a lot the knowledge you gain from lecture The more historical facts you read about the more complicated the picture of the war becomes and the more nuanced the explanations for the causes become Many students form study groups for this course and it is fairly easy to create one since everyone is on the lookout for reading buddies The New York Times is an important component of this class both for exams and precepts I created the habit of reading it weekly for three hours in a row the day before precept Reading daily for 20 minutes could have been more beneficial but this is a component of the course that you absolutely cannot cramp for the night before the exam This part is very relaxed and open ended It is due on Deans Date The type of writing required is similar to a diary entry You can choose any book that is related to an experience of war and then put down the impressions you were left with This part is meant to bring in some emotional reflections after all the cold blooded discussions of war during the semester IV External ResourcesEvery major news source constitutes a good external resource for the class although Prof Bass recommends the New York Times Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica can also help to lookup historical facts V What Students Should Know About This Course For Purposes Of Course SelectionAlthough this class has a high number it is taken by a lot of by non politics non social sciences students as an SA It provides you with an immense knowledge about 20th century history and about 21st century state of international affairs It can put you in the habit of periodically reading the news and teach you how to make more sense of the news you are reading ",

            "text": "I Description of Course Goals CurriculumHIS 211 is a survey class of the history of Europe from Antiquity to the Renaissance A big focus in this class is given to Ancient Greece and the development of Christianity and all of the forms it took throughout Europe For each period of European history Prof Grafton prefers to talk about the shape the society took in that period rather than about individual events He gives an overview of the religious economic technological cultural architectural developments of the time Two or three individuals become the focus for each period so that through the writings from them or about them we can understand the whole of society This explains why the course never requires any memorization of historical dates names of kings or other details Rather it aims to help the students reach an understanding of the forces religious cultural scientific and technological that shaped European civilization  From a different students perspective In the Fall 2015 course there was an in class quiz that tested knowledge of specific people a midterm that had a section on identification of peoples names and objects historical practices and a portion on the final that tested knowledge of specific concepts or figures In this case in addition to knowledge of overarching themes through Western Civilization students do need to spend some time memorizing the importance of specific people and concepts though never dates II Learning From Classroom InstructionAt the beginning of each lecture Prof Grafton delivers a sheet which contains key words divided in sections The keywords follow the order that the lecture is going to follow The lecture is large and there is no student interaction Professor Grafton is a very eloquent speaker which means that the lecture is fast paced However this is not the type of lecture in which you need to put down everything since Prof Grafton can go into very detailed descriptions or examples that he uses for the purpose of making clearer the ideas he is conveying The sheet he gives at the beginning of the lecture has a lot of space to take notes I took all of my notes on these sheets and the correspondence between my notes and the key words made the structure of the lecture clear when reading afterwards You can also take notes on a separate notebook but it is important to clear out the correspondence between key words on the sheet and your paper since this will help to understand the main ideas of the lecture  He does not allow computers in lecture so you will have to rely on handwritten notes and his lecture handout when reviewing notes It can be helpful to type up your notes right after lecture so that you can make it legible and structured on a Word document and add anything that comes to mind from lecture that you hadnt written down This also allows you to use the command find option later in the semester when you are trying to remember a concept from weeks prior In precept we talked exclusively about the readings which for this class are in the form of written documents from the period under examination One of the most important questions asked from the readings was what we could infer from them about the historical period We also evaluated the reliability of each source and compared sources Precept is important because it is an indicator of the most important sources from the readings the ones which will show up on the exam and the discussions happening in precept are the ones that come closer to the type of thinking required from the class and the exams Thus taking notes of which sources were discussed in precept and some main things discussed about those sources can be of great help when preparing for exams  Every week the day before precept my preceptor required a short paragraph with observations or questions from that weeks reading not summaries This factored into the participation grade for precepts It is also useful to write down the questions that the preceptor asks in precept When looking back on readings during exam studying it is helpful have reminders of what should be considered about each text Also make note of parallels and comparisons preceptor and other students draw between that weeks reading with any readings or lecture material that is from prior weeks You will be asked to identify five 5 6 line quotes on the midterm and final exams Because of this it would be useful to make flashcards after each precept of the important quotes that your preceptor drew out from each primary source document If every week you write the name and author of the document on one side and the quote on the other by the end of the semester you will have an effective study tool for your final exam III Learning For and From Assignments and AssessmentsThis course has about 100 pages of reading per week an in class midterm and final examination and a 5 7 page final paper  In Fall 2015 and Fall 2016 there was also an in class quiz made up of identification terms around Week 3 In Fall 2015 weekly readings ranged from 100 200 pages of reading but the average was closer to 150 200 pages a week The readings include the readings from the History of Western Civilization which is a sort of history textbook and the readings from the books that contain all the first hand documents letters etc from a certain historical period The second type of readings are the most important ones since you will be discussing them in precept and will be asked to identify them on the exam The first one provides more historical detail than the lectures however you are never asked to know more than is provided on the lecture When reading the first hand documents it is of great help to underline some of the parts that seem more important or expressive of the themes discussed in lecture this will help when going through these readings again to study for the exams Also be aware that some of the documents provide way too much detail for example the legal documents For this class it is more important to focus on texts that describe or are written by a specific individuals since they are also some of the most expressive and telling first hand documents of the period The midterm includes ID s and key word questions For the key word questions you are given terms that are of historic importance never obscure ones and you write what you have learnt about these terms For the ID questions you are given a passage from the first hand document you have read and you are required to identify the passage and its author describe how you managed to identify it style hints on the text and finally describe the historical significance of the passage Describing the historical significance of the passage is the most important part of the question and it requires both an evaluation of why this text was important for the historical period when it was produced and why this text is important to us in order to understand the historical period when it was produced This type of thinking happens during precept but it is also important that you practice it with what you see as the most important documents from your readings  If you have made flashcards of quotes for each of the significant readings by going through and reviewing each card you will be able to study for quote identifications even if the exact quote does not match your flashcard your understanding of the authors tone or argument will help you By making a flashcard for each ofProfessor Graftons terms from the lecture handouts you will have a useful tool for studying for the keyword identification portion of the exam as well The exam has the same questions as the midterm this time only from the second part of the semester and one essay question The essay questions all have very broad themes the themes that you have encountered during the semester and that Prof Grafton has underlined in the lectures During the last lecture he will also mention the most important themes of the course When studying for the essay part it is thus more helpful to study the course material in a thematic way rather than in a chronological way List all of the most important themes religion architecture science the city etc and then think about all of the events and texts related to each theme  If you have typed your notes it can be helpful to print out your notes and use different color highlighters to keep track of themes present at each historical moment so that you can go through your notes chronologically and by theme at the same time See the midterm section for tools on studying for quote and keyword IDs The topic choice for the final paper is extremely open ended You have to choose some document or a series of documents from the period of Antiquity until Renaissance that has not been discussed in precept Once you have chosen a text that you like then you can decide about your thesis Since you read so many documents during the class there will usually be one or two texts that you have found very interesting and have not been discussed in precept Starting from there will take you to your thesis with the help of your preceptor It is important to stay modest in the scope of the paper since it is only a 5 6 pages one  The close reading you are asked to do for your final paper is similar to the way in which your preceptor has led analysis of primary sources in precept The questions that the preceptor asks that you have written down can also serve as jumping off points when you are trying to structure your argument IV External ResourcesI used the Encyclopedia Britannica many times when I would notice some key word a name or place on the sheet that Prof Grafton gave us and would not remember what it meant V What Students Should Know About This Course For Purposes Of Course SelectionBeing a 200 level class this class is less demanding than many other history courses at Princeton which makes it a very famous HA option The class approaches learning about history in an entirely new way compared to many high school programs so it can be very interesting even if you have learnt a lot about European history  In some ways this class is less demanding than other history courses the only paper due is 5 7 pages instead of two papers that might each be 8 15 pages long for example Also the readings discussed in precept are mainly primary sources so they often flow more narratively and are less dense or verbose than scholarly articles However the course might be more demanding than other history courses for this reason students are expected to keep track of changing themes over thousands of years of history for essay style questions on exams but are also expected to remember names and specific quotes from a total of about 1 000 pages of reading of primary sources over the course of the semester Professor Grafton and preceptors do introduce specific themes to follow but if you have not had prior exposure to this history the names and concepts might take longer to understand and place in the larger context A note underclassmen should not shy away from 300 and 400 level courses in the humanities nor should they automatically enroll in 200 level courses The number level does not signify level of difficulty Instead it signifies the structure of the course 200 level courses like this one are often large lecture courses that cover a topic in breadth while 300 level courses are slightly more focused and 400 level courses dive deeply into one specific topic and are mainly small seminar classes rarely large lecture style courses ",

            "text": "Description of Course Goals CurriculumThis class is a survey course of the most important writings in the recent field of media theory It examines the writings in a chronological order going through all of the most important media the camera obscura the gramophone cinema TV and the web Some of the themes examined through all of the writings are language and orality the disembodiment of seeing the role of the body in a technological world media and ideology Some of the most famous authors read in the class are Derrida Kittler Heidegger whereas the others are authors more specific to the field of media theory Besides introducing the students to the field of media theory the class asks questions about how the media influences the way we perceive ourselves and we see the world This is a very broad question and indeed the essays and the exams allow students to approach this question from the aspects that they have found more interesting in the class II Learning From Classroom InstructionLecture is very fast paced since Prof Fore is reading from his notes written in a very elaborate language and there is a lot to cover The lectures go over the readings and explain them In slides some important quotes from the readings are displayed It is hard to take notes of everything one might have to do with very shortened bullet points of the lecture or simply try to internalize as much of the lecture as possible simply by listening This is why one has to have read the texts for the days lecture beforehand to make the most of the lecture In precept we discussed the readings and many times ended up trying to clarify passages of the text In the next section the readings for the class are explained III Learning For and From Assignments and AssessmentsThe class has about 100 pages of reading per week two short essays one 150 words response weekly a midterm and a final examination For Spring 2016 the students could choose to write a 12 page paper in lieu of the exam The readings for this class can be very dense at times so it could take longer to go through them than expected This is especially true for the readings that are more philosophical However for these harder texts you will not be asked to explain every argument in detail but for an understanding of the general ideas So dont be scared if this is the first time you are encountering something like Derridas writing and it is impossible to go past the first sentence Since the exams have ID questions reading study groups would not be a good idea for this class It is extremely important to underline passages that seem important and write some notes in the margins since for the final you will be asked to write essays using quotes from the texts reads After doing the readings you are to write a short 150 words response online If while reading you find something that interests you or you have a short thought about it write it down immediately since that could be a good candidate for your response The midterm was very short 25 minutes and you were asked to identify the source of 3 short passages To prepare for the midterm you could go through all of the slides with Prof Fores quotes and also through all of the passages that you have underlined in your readings Remember to memorize the title of the text as well not just the author I took the final exam instead of writing a paper so I am going to talk about the exam This time the exam was a three hour take home although Prof Fore had initially planned for it to be in class this might be the case in the next semesters We were asked to write two essays using three of the texts we had read for each and we were asked to quote passages from these texts to support our arguments I have to essay that writing this final was a rush The topics given were thematic for example the disembodiment of seeing the immateriality of bodies the ideological influence of the media They were broad enough that you had a lot of freedom in terms of choosing the texts you were going to write about The topics are very important ones for the field of media theory and during the exam I had to accept that I would not be able to write everything I wanted to about the topic given the time limit There was also no time to go through the texts I had chosen and pick my quotes carefully rather I had to be content with the quotes that I had underlined and were more stuck in my mind This means that when preparing for the exam it is important to underline some of the most important passages of the text and write a note on the side that summarizes the content of the passage in two three words Then you could go through the passages underlined two or three times so you can recall some of them Do not worry if you do not possess a good knowledge and underlining of each text since the essay topics give you enough freedom to choose the texts you feel more comfortable with There are two short essays two pages long each For these essays Prof Fore gives a topic and then you can choose your own example from which you approach the topic For example in one of the essays we were to analyze a movie scene of our choice using a text we had read in class Since we are pretty attached to a certain forms of media it is possible to choose some example that one finds interesting and have fun writing a short essay about it IV External ResourcesEncyclopedia Britannica or Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy online to look for all of the philosophical and media theory terms that you are unfamiliar with V What Students Should Know About This Course For Purposes Of Course SelectionThis course can be used as an EC requirement or as a class for a German Certificate During the class we watched many movie clips and other forms of media but that is not the main focus of the class this is a more theory heavy class than one would expect ",

between subsequent topics in comparison to the first half The most difficult part about this class was that the lecture slides were not posted online the professor expects lecture to essentially be a review of what was covered in the book chapters which you are expected to read before class and to expand on topics that the book does not cover thoroughly Thus you may have to adapt different reading note taking strategies in comparison to traditional PowerPoint oriented lectures given by professors who post the slides online following the class session in order to get the most out of lecture There were no outstanding hidden expectations this is an intro class after all The only caveat with problem sets is that no collaboration with other students is allowed This course is centered on application of linguistic methodologies and tools Your grade is composed of problem sets exams and precept participation but primarily the former two Writtenassignments will require you to apply the methods that you have learned in addition to recalling a modest quantity of theory and factual information Though in order to maximize your understanding in lecture it may be helpful to do the reading beforehand the reading was not so necessary for doing well on the assignments Lecture is a quick overview of topics that were covered in reading and a preview of what will be covered in written assignments As mentioned the lecture slides are not posted online and are not very text heavy It may be more helpful to listen what the professor says and write down key take aways with pen and notebook computers are not allowed during lecture Alluding to the point that reading before lecture is not necessary to do well in the course grade wise it is noteworthy to mention that problem sets and the final were open book notes So if there is something specific that you missed from lecture you simply need to remember or find out where in the book the corresponding material is located Precept is very helpful to attend for this course It is what links the theory coveredin lecture to practice that is assessed on written assignments It usually begins with a review of the topics covered in lecture followed by some practice examples from the book Hence it is important to come prepared with your textbook Since the most important lecture material is reviewed in precept it is not necessary to review lecture notes before precept Lecture notes should be more of a method of retention of key take aways However it might be helpful to review examples covered in precept soon afterwards This could expedite completion of the problem sets as the problems assigned are similar in structure and material to that which is covered in precept The problem sets in this class are mainly designed to help you practice the methods that are covered in lecture There is not much factual recall included The specific structure of the homework problems will not be exactly like the examples covered in precept However the precept problems will be similar in content and methodology relative to the homework so it is very helpful to attend precept In preparing for problem sets it may be helpful to review precept notes Since assignments are open book notes it might be useful to consult the syllabus for direction with respect to matching book chapters to topics covered in specific lectures No collaboration with other students is allowed on the problem sets so be sure to seek out the help of a preceptor or the professor if you are having issues with the material There are two exams in this course a midterm and a final The midterm is a timed in class exam and the problems look a lot like the homework problems both in structure and methodology If you have reviewed precept material and can do the homework problems without fault or hesitation then you will be in good shape for the midterm The final was an open book notes exam that you could work on over the course of several days so there shouldnt be an issue of time There may be some problems that look like the homework midterm problems in addition to some memory recall Your notes from lecture precept and the book can be of use Note that you cannot use the internet or lecture slides past years included for this exam but you should not need them so long as you are able to find where certain topics are located in the book There are also no exams available from previous years YouTube videos could be helpful in understanding how different languages vernacular and accents have developed alongside each other and in understanding how neurological disorders affect communication in real life Since you cannot collaborate with other students on the problem sets the preceptors and professor try to make themselves available if you are having trouble with a specific topic or methodology If you cant meet with your specific preceptor seek out another one or the professor This is a great course to take as a distribution requirement It is usually referred to as an easy class to get a good grade in and a fail proof P D F option My experience was pretty supportive of these claims However people sometimes fail to mention the interesting nature of the material covered Dr Ross Feldman did a great job of incorporatinganecdotes andincluding findings from current research in linguisticsinto lectures which made the information sound a lot more relevant relatable and simply interesting Especially if you are P D Fing this is a greatopportunity to have the experience of putting the pen down and engaging with the material in the moment by just listening and thinking something that you probably wish you could do more of in your other classes Since this course is a well encompassing survey of topics in linguistics that you can further pursue at Princeton anyone who is even slightly considering the linguistics certificate should takeit Overall the workloadis relatively light reasonable and enjoyable ",

            "text": "MAT201 is an introduction to multivariable calculus designed for students who have already taken calculus either in high school or at Princeton Math majors should consider MAT203 instead A solid calculus background is important especially at the beginning of the course when concepts such as functions limits and integrals are redefined for multiple variables The first week focuses on objects in space such as planes and quadric surfaces that will be used throughout the semester and having a very good understanding of these will make the rest of the semester much more manageable The course then focuses on multivariable functions and their properties Part of the material like partial derivatives relies heavily on knowledge from normal calculus while Lagrange multipliers for example are a completely new concept After looking at double and triple integrals the last few weeks are then dedicated to Green Stokes and Gauss theorems This is for many students the most challenging part of the course The instructors focus mostly on mathematical concepts but pertinent application to physics is covered too While it is not a requirement for PHY104 there is an overlap and both courses would benefit from being taken together Classes meet three times a week in small groups There is no common lecture but all students complete the same assignments and take the same tests The instructors cover all the material needed for the tests during classes or will provide the name of the chapters that have to be covered by the student if there is not enough time to cover everything during precept It is recommended to do the reading before class However I found the material complicated to understand without previous explanations and not all the material covered in the textbook was pertinent for the assignments and the tests although all the material covered is in the textbook I thus suggest skimming the textbook before class and then coming back after class to read the appropriate chapters in more details Knowing about the general concepts before class was really helpful but it is not necessary to go over the examples or even the formulas This can be done after precept while doing the problem set for example It is essential to take notes during precept especially because some of the material is difficult to understand when explained the first time I often had to read over my notes after class in order to get a good grasp of the material Your notes will also be helpful to remember which parts of the chapters you should focus on when studying I learned the most from the weekly problem sets They generally covered the material from the preceding week but I sometimes had to read ahead of what we were doing in class in order to do some of the problems The first problems usually test that you know the right formulas and when to apply them while the problems at the end of the problem set are often more difficult and test understanding rather than memorization For example the first problem might ask you to find the triple integral of a function while the last one asks you to find the volume of a solid Mathematically these two problems are very similar but you will need to actually understand what a triple integral is instead of just knowing how to solve it in order to solve the second one The examples in the textbook are a wonderful resource both for the problem set and to study for the quizzes and the tests Another alternative is to look at the odd problems just before or after the problem that is assigned for the problem test They are often similar in type and the solutions are available at the back of the book The quizzes were about the same difficulty as the more difficult problems of the problem set In order to study for the quiz I did practice problems from the textbook that were similar to the problems in the assignment There are also a lot of practice quizzes available which you can take while timing yourself While the midterm and the final were challenging because of the problems themselves the main difficulty for the quiz was the time limit This is why it is important to be able to solve problems quickly by doing more practice problems outside of the problem set The problems in the midterm and the final were more difficult than most of the problems in the book and I studied mostly by doing the practice tests At the end of the course I also found it important to take the time to go over Green Stokes and Gauss theorems very slowly in the textbook These theorems are crucial to multivariable calculus but there is little time to go over them in precept They also look similar to each other at least at the beginning and it took me a long time to completely understand them and to be able to solve problems from previous finals on these topics MAT201 can sometimes feel very computation heavy especially toward the middle of the semester but the grading takes into account the understanding of the material not only the correctness of the final answer For this reason and because it also helped organize the material in my mind I tried to give a clear structure to my answers For example there are many tools you can use to solve multivariable limits and it is very helpful to go through a list from the most common strategy to the most specialized when solving these types of problems Office hours were a great opportunity to address difficulties but also to get over material that had not been covered in depth in precept I mostly went to my instructors office hours but if these do not fit in your schedule it is also possible to go to the office hours of one of the many other instructors McGraw also offers study halls and individual tutoring Finally some videos online can be helpful to better visualize some structures in 3D MAT201 is offered both in the fall and in the spring It is a requirement for many science and engineering majors Students interested in majoring in economics can take MAT175 instead Math majors usually take MAT215 but might take MAT203 if they are interested in more applied math MAT104 or BC Calculus are required before taking the class ",

            "text": "The central goal of this course is to provide you with a thorough knowledge of climate processes and climate history to allow you to have informed and intelligent conversations about the issue of global warming There are five units in this course and they are organized thematically The first unit is the longest and it focuses on climate processes in generalatmospheric oceanic and glacial cycles This first unit provides the background necessary for informed discussion in the second unit which delves into modern climate and climate warming The last three units move more quickly the third focuses on ongoing glacial cycles ice ages and interglacial periods which leads into the fourth unit about climate over Earths history All of these first four units culminate in the final synthesis unit about the implications of climate history for future climate as well as responses to climate change The description of this course says that it is intended to be accessible to non science majors and this is absolutely true no background knowledge is assumed This class consists of two 80 minute lectures one lab and a reading from the textbook each week Lectures are the heart of the class especially because there are students taking GEO 102A the same course with the same lectures and exams but without the lab component Professor Sigman is a dynamic and animated lecturer and he works to keep students involved he does demonstrations with anything from balloons to beach balls and he frequently has students work on practice problems and answer clicker questions However one challenge is that each lecture covers a lot of material in great detail and at a pretty rapid pace The information in each lecture is cumulativeso if you lose focus or become confused youll miss information necessary to understand the rest of the lecture which makes it hard to become engaged again A good way to grapple with this challenge is to balance between listening and note taking because Sigman posts lecture slides after class each day and these slides are pretty comprehensive it is not necessary to copy down all the text on the slides In fact it can be a detrimentwriting down every word can make it hard to listen and absorb what Sigman is saying It is better to use the slides as guides to organize the information and then to write notes on the information that the lecture slides alone do not explain in a way that youll be able to understand going forward as well as any details that Sigman emphasizes If taken advantage of labs can be a really useful way to solidify understanding of key concepts from lecture The labs themselves are pretty straightforward they are usually simulations demonstrations rather than experiments in which youre actually collecting data or analyzing results Because theyre straightforward it can be easy to go through them somewhat mindlessly But actively questioning whether you understand why youre actually doing the demonstration and how it connects to the core themes and processes of the class pays off both when working on the lab reports and in terms of overall understanding The textbook reading is not as important to the course Professor Sigman is transparent in saying that nothing that is described in the textbook but is not mentioned in lecture will appear on the exams and this is absolutely true The reading can help with understanding but I found it to be more valuable to spend my time reviewing lecture notes slides and making sure that I understood them than putting a lot of time into the textbook reading There are three primary graded components of this class take home open book quizzes on Blackboard lab reports and the midterm and final exam Because the take home quizzes on Blackboard are open book and have no time limit many students were surprised to find that they still could be challenging They primarily involve multiple choice and fill in the blank questions and the thing that makes them challenging is that they often test for details However most of the answers can be found within the slides themselves only occasionally are they based on something that Sigman said in class but is not explicitly mentioned in the slides as long as you are familiar with and understand the slides The key to doing well on these quizzes was 1 being willing to block off a solid chunk of time to take the quizzesif you do these quizzes quickly and try to trust your instincts memory you may miss some counterintuitive answers 2 going to lecture and actively listening taking notes because familiarity with the material allows you to know where to search in the slides for answers and 3 emailing Professor Sigman if there are any questions that confuse yousometimes the language is unclear and Sigman is completely willing to clarify if you just reach out Lab reports for this class are not like typical lab reports you do not need to write up introduction procedures results etc Instead they involve answering 5 synthesis questions that test your understanding of broad underlying concepts from labs and lecture and your ability to apply those concepts to the real world problems These can be challenging primarily if youre having difficulty with a particular concept e g deep ocean circulation because fully understanding the underlying processes is central to being able to answer the questions Another challenge is that sometimes the questions sound open ended but theyre actually looking for a specific answer Both of these challenges can be addressed by working on lab reports early in the week so that if there are any questions you dont understand you can meet with your lab TA If you work early and email or meet with your lab TA with any questions it is very manageable to do well on lab reports Finally the largest components of your grade are the midterm and final exams Like the quizzes these are mostly multiple choice and fill in the blank The challenge of these exams is the sheer volume of material that you need to keep track of in general they test recall of information and understanding of processes more than application of concepts although there are a handful of questions about application Make sure that you are familiar with all of the information covered on the lecture slidesyou need to be able recognize though not memorize anything that came up in lecture From there it is helpful to make flashcards from the material on the slides and from lecture notes in order to really nail down the key points from each unit Though it was important to have a pretty in depth and detailed comprehension of the material it wasnt necessary to memorize random dates e g different geological time periods and figures Above all its most important to make sure you understand the underlying processes e g energy transport atmospheric circulation ocean circulation glacial cycles in detail Going back over lab reports and talking through processes with a classmate is really helpful for this The one other element that can contribute to your grade in the course is attendance as mentioned previously Professor Sigman incorporates practice problems into lecture At the end of lecture these problems are collected and you receive full credit simply for turning them in Completion of these problems is not normally calculated into your final grade but if youre on the border between two scales it can tip the scale Though she is not technically an external resource Danielle Schmitt is somebody involved in organizing the class but she often goes overlooked by students because she does not have a clear or official teaching role But emailing or meeting with her can be incredibly helpful Professor Sigman is wonderful but sometimes his brilliance and the depth of his scientific knowledge can make it hard for him to explain concepts in simple ways Danielle is less of a high powered scientist and shes great at breaking things down and explaining processes in simple terms The understanding that you gain in this course is really valuable and relevant to discussions about global warming and environmental issues Almost every day I see some article about climate change or hear some politicians stance on the issue and I feel that I now have the knowledge to mentally fact check these claims There are two branches of this coursethe lab course 102B and the non lab course 102A While both are great options I found that labs were really helpful in solidifying my understanding My friends who did not take the lab sometimes found it hard to be actively engaged with the material simply because there are no precepts or regular homework assignments As a result without the lab reports forcing them to think about the core processes they said that it was easy to get a bit lost in the material without fully realizing it until a few days before an exam However if you do elect to take the non lab section be aware of this challenge going in and make sure to review lecture notes regularly put time and thought into the take home quizzes and go to Professor Sigmans office hours ",

            "text": "This course The Literature of EnvironmentalDisasterlooks at natural and anthropogenic environmental crises through the lens of comparative literature A variety of text styles are brought in to reflect on this issue rangingfromplays eg Endgame Fin de Partie by Samuel Beckett to novels eg Animals People by Indra Sinha to journalistic exposs eg The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert Each week focuses on a particular topic of natural disaster For example Fall 2014 covered Overview of Natural Disasters Fossil Fuels Apocalypse Plague Industrial Pollution Megadams Oil Spills Industrial Catastrophe e g Bhopal Nuclear Disaster e g Chernobyl Agribusiness Polemical Journalism Species Extinction and Post apocalyptic Thought All of these topics are addressed through key literary texts rather than the scientific or political documents historical accounts or primary sources that might be seen as conventional However each week academic texts are brought to bear on the subject to supplement the literary analysis The lectures in thiscourse areconducted in English and all readings and assignments can be read and written in English However for students interested inFrench or who wish to gain credit for a French certificate reading responses will bewritten in French and the readingswhich were originally written in French should be read without translation The readings and discussion of the readings are central to this course and are the foundation of its analysis of environmental disasters However the majority of the grade comes from written assignments There aretworeading responses due each quarter each 1 2 pages in length When the student writes a response to that weeks reading they will be asked to share their insights in class to spur discussion The midterm paper 5 6 pages asks students to delve deeper into a particular text from the first half of the semester while the final paper 10 12 pages allows students to either compare multiple texts read throughout the course or to extensively explore one text while bringing in a research component Listening and participating in class is the central component of this course even though most of the grade actually stems from the written responses Classroom instruction was structured more in terms of a precept stylelecture with audience participation than a seminar Blix will present his knowledgeon an issue and then ask for clarifying questions or else ask a question listen to the responses and then present his own interpretation These lectures are key to learning and engaging with the material and will give insights into the more difficult texts finding connections that you might not havenoticed on your own Pay attention and stay engaged just for the purposes of getting the most out of the class and fully enjoying the literature However the assignments are mostly focused on making individual interpretations so the lecture can inspire ideas but wont directly support completion of the assignments There are 4 reading responses each 1 2 pages double spaced Two are due before Fall Break and two before Winter Break These can be done at any point in the quarter when the student has time or is particularly interested in the topic at hand These assignments give space for the student to reflect further on the reading They require a completereading of the assigned reading but can be anything from detailed series of questioning topersonal reflection totopical scientific or literary analysis These short response papers are due the night before class then used in class to spur discussion The midterm paper requiresdeeper analysis of a particular text not necessarilyone of the ones the student has already responded to The final paper is longer and allows for comparison across multipletexts or uses outside resources to delve deeper into one text Again these papers alsoallow for individual interests to be expressed Some students in my class were more interested in the scientific aspects of the material and preferred to write technically on the scientific basis of the disaster Others were more interested in the nuances of the literary style and delved deep into the metaphors and imagery of the texts Still others were more interested in the historical background the political implications and the ethical question This diversity of perspectives was thoroughlyencouraged and in my opinion was the major benefitof this class This class is pretty self contained no external resources are very necessary Supplementary readings are all on Blackboard including the video reserves Firestone has some of the books if you need the French translation of the course books or if you need related books forcomparison forthe final paper The Princeton Public Library also has some of the course books in French and fun fact Public Library membership is free for Princeton University Students This course has relatively high but completely manageable reading levels The policies on completing the assignments when you choose makes the workload flexible which can be very helpful to busy students The texts are varied well written relevant and memorable I found the subject matter extremely interesting but also somewhat depressing as you might be able to expect from its emphasis on disaster This topic seems to beBlixs personal specialty and interest so he is very engaged and knowledgeable throughout the semester he kept organising and speaking at conferences on this exact subject The major benefit of this class in my opinion is the diversity of opinions and perspectives it brings to the table Being cross listed in 3 departments only starts to show what a multi dimensional approach this course takes to the topic of environmental disaster Its just so cool to be talking about literary imagery journalistic ethics scientific principles political theories and environmental history all within the space of an hour For this reason I would say that this course is ideal for people with wide ranging interests or those who want to widen their experience of their major or certificate in Comp Lit Environmental Studies or French ",

            "text": "OverviewMOL 214 is a course that builds a strong base in general molecular biology through the application of certain principles in an experimental context Historical experiments are emphasized throughout the course as they demonstrate the mechanics of biology being implemented in a real life setting Problem sets and exams demand the ability to construct experiments and predict outcomes using the building blocks of molecular biology Course OrganizationThe course is organized in a hierarchical cumulative manner where the material taught at the beginning of the course is built on with each successive class There are three main divisions in the material of the course DNA and the Genome RNA processing and Cell Signaling and Epigenetics The course does not necessarily require any previous knowledge of biology although it is helpful to have a background in the subject as the course moves very quickly and can become quite complicated if one does not stay on top of the lectures It is of utmost importance to have an extremely strong grasp of the hierarchical organization within the first section of the course DNA and the Genome because these principles are applied with the most frequency in the other two sections as compared to any other principles Cell Signaling and Epigenetics are highly related therefore there is a high degree of overlap towards the end of the course Challenging about acquiring knowledgeAs a subject Biology is generally stereotyped as being the topic which requires strict memorization and regurgitation Many students begin the class with this attitude and thus struggle to excel in problem sets lab reports and exams When such a large amount of information is presented at such a fast pace it can become overwhelming to be expected to truly master the processes and fundamental ideas of the course A reasonable approach to this dilemma is to allow oneself to learn the material through the problem sets That being said one should still review the powerpoint lecture notes thoroughly in order to grasp the general idea presented However in order to really mentally enforce the information and ensure good comprehension one should focus on the problem sets and take note of how one is required to sometimes think in a backwards manner where you are not necessarily asked what the definition of X is or what Xs purpose is but rather you are presented with an outcome and you must deduce what processes molecules may have caused this outcome This type of thinking is really beneficial because it is what is most present on the exams It tests the difference between someone who has just memorized the information versus someone who can explain processes and concepts and how theyre involved in other processes in the biological world Students who succeed can mentally map processes and concepts and show how they are interconnected at a complicated level a more fundamental level or both Hidden expectationsThis course did not require any previous knowledge of molecular biology The first few lectures regarding the building blocks of molecular biology were taught in a manner that assumed no previous exposure to biology on any level This is one of the strong points of the course because the professors understand that the students taking the course come from all different backgrounds of biology knowledge so they teach the material in a very comprehensive way to assure that everyone can follow it easily The closest thing to a hidden expectation in this course is extra time outside of lecture and lab to dedicate to the optional weekly review sessions Although one may very well succeed in the course without the additional review sessions the sessions facilitate the understanding portion of the course to later allow the student to dedicate more time to the application portion One cannot begin to tackle the application problems without wholly understanding the themes and this cannot be stressed enough LecturesLectures are the core component to learning in MOL 214 At the beginning of each lecture presentation the learning goals for that lecture are outlined these give you a clear guideline of what concepts you should understand by the end of each lecture and when you are studying Also these are especially helpful to review before you attend the next lecture The lecture slides themselves break down more general concepts into specific subsections The titles are the subsections of the learning goals general concepts and often feature keywords The slides tend not to have many words but rather rely on a visual component to explain concepts It is important to note however that the few words that are mentioned will most likely be words you are expected to know and use on exams unless explicitly told otherwise Although a lot of information is thrown at you in lecture if you understand how the slides are broken down then it is much easier to keep up in class Also dont be afraid to stop the professor and ask questions Finally another important feature of lecture is the iClicker questions distributed throughout the lecture slides These questions tend to be application based and preview the type of questions that are asked on problem sets and exams In terms of note taking the method you choose greatly depends on what helps you most to remember and study large amounts of information Handwritten notes make it easier to draw diagrams and you have ample space to mark down questions you might have in margins Typed notes can be easier to read and format and pictures can be added in online Finally many people opt to print out the slides and take notes directly on the slides so that they know exactly what information corresponds to each slide or concept No matter which method you choose make sure you write down as much as you can even if it does not make sense You can always ask questions and organize your notes later but you do not want to miss out an important detail Recording lectures may make note taking in class less stressful so you can focus on listening and general understanding during class Even if you record the lectures however taking notes is a definite must LabsOther than lectures labs are great ways to apply the concepts you discuss in class The labs begin with a simple lab quiz for which you are expected to have reviewed and understood the pre lab material posted on Blackboard There is no need to memorize the procedure however The best way to prepare for the quiz is to simply read the manual and background information a few times and note down important figures or procedures that stand out to you Labs that are done over a period of a week for example may have a pre lab question that asks about what day X will require Labs are done in partners and there is a lab manual at each desk You are also expected to keep a bound lab notebook that outlines the purpose general procedure and experimental observations and data Though they tend not to be incredibly long it is recommended that you do not do lab reports last minute as there are many graphical components that can be time consuming Lab reports are great ways to synthesize concepts learned in class in an experimental setting Classroom Expectations Other than being prepared for lab the only real expectation of MOL 214 is to seek help when needed The professors are very vocal about the resources available and are always willing to help Do not wait until the week before the exam to ask the questions you have had all semester and to finally review previous lectures because other students will also have the same idea If you stay on top of the lectures you should be coming up with questions on a weekly basis for the pertinent lecture Getting these questions answered within the same week is more beneficial than waiting until the week before the test because the material is still very fresh in your mind Problem setsThe problem sets are one of the most valuable resources for this course They are designed in a manner very similar to that of the exam so fully understanding the problem sets as well as being able to complete them without any outside help or hints is a good indicator of whether or not one will be able to succeed in the exams The problem sets are the perfect opportunity to practice ones application skills of the material learned that week in lecture As the course heavily emphasizes the ability to think an experimental manner and deduce cause effect patterns within processes experiments the problem sets allow one to not only drill the information for the week but also to guarantee that one knows the information both backwards and forwards As previously mentioned backwards thinking is a common skill that is necessary in the course If one completes the problem sets without any external help they will begin to adjust their thinking patterns to become more like those of the professors The problem sets are like a glimpse into the professors mind Although the problems themselves will not be repeated in the exam the type of thinking required to solve these problem set problems will most definitely be used with much frequency in the examinations Lab reportsLab reports are another opportunity to cultivate the necessary thinking skills for exams The questions proposed for each lab report force students to use the same skills that they would in both the problem sets as well as the exams One should go through the lab manual before each lab and understand why each step was taken This is critical in answering the questions at the end of the lab for the lab report Lab reports are similar to exams and problem sets in the sense that a question is proposed and several steps are enumerated The students job is to understand why each step must be carried out in order to solve the problem as well as be able to predict what will happen after each step is conducted The specific labs that are conducted throughout the course will not necessarily appear on the exams Once again however the student becomes conditioned to think in a manner that applies the concepts learned in lecture to a more experimental context Lab TAs are very specific graders and one must follow the instructions of the lab report word for word Points are taken off for small details such as missing units unlabeled axes etc For this reason it is essential to be very precise in every lab report Several lab reports will actually ask for an explanation of why a certain step was taken so if one takes the time before the lab to internalize the purpose of each step these questions can be answered with much ease ExamsAs emphasized throughout this guide the course places a large importance on the application of principles to an experimental context Students should be prepared to design experiments predict the outcome and thoroughly explain results in practically every exam question The exams tend to have about 15 multiple questions at the beginning that drill your understanding of the material at hand In order to best prepare for these questions strict memorization will not be sufficient Once again one must be able to not only explain a concept or process but apply it to other processes learned in the course Because the course is cumulative the multiple choice questions could expect you to recall past information from previous lectures in order to arrive at the answer but it will not explicitly state this Therefore being able to mentally map the concepts and interconnect them is very helpful because it allows one to see the connections between each topic The rest of the exam will be short answer questions where one will be presented either with an experiment or a certain situation These questions are graded on whether or not you have key words present in the answers along with whether or not they are used in the correct fashion to describe the situation Many times if a key word is not included one will lose points Therefore when taking the exam be sure to either mentally or physically make a quick list of important key words related to your potential answer Here is a list of the types of things that one would most likely have to do for the short answer questions on an exam The lecture slides and problem sets should be the main sources of test preparation material The textbook reading is listed as optional and is not completely necessary to succeed in the class It is recommended to read the book only if attending review sessions and reviewing lectures notes are not successful The textbook is actually quite dense and gives more information that one really needs for purposes of the class Therefore the textbook could actually confuse the student more than help the student understand the principles better Going through each slide of the lecture notes is of utmost importance Key words are usually present on each slide and these should be understood well not only in the context of the given slide but also within the lecture as a whole Diagrams present in the slides are key in reviewing processes A helpful method is to look at a diagram and try to explain it to a friend paying close attention to the key words and weaving them into ones explanation Certain lectures will provide mental maps of concepts recently learned Recreating those maps on a separate piece of paper but adding in ones own personal notes is very helpful because it forces one to organize all of the information that they have mastered onto something more visual and concrete Although the problem sets are what really reflect the questions on the exam one cannot begin to study from the problem sets before making sure that all the concepts in the lectures have been understood very thoroughly Problem sets should always be reviewed before exams One should try and rework the problems without looking at the solutions or previous methods of approach in order to test whether or not one can think in the appropriate manner on the spot After completing the problem and checking the answer one should unsolve the problem or rather think backwards in order to guarantee full mastery of not only the concept but the application of the concept and its significance on a larger scale within the biological world In this class it isnt very often that there are different solutions to a given problem but there are most definitely many ways to express an answer This is key because reading an answer from another student or professor may allow one to think about the problem in a different light revealing a helpful way to approach other similar problems Weekly Review Sessions These 2 hour sessions are held twice a week Each session covers the same material but they are simply on different dates to accommodate others schedules They cover the previous two lectures providing clearer explanations and images to concepts discussed in morning lectures The pace is much slower than in lecture so it does not go into as much detail except for crucial processes The lower attendance and slower pace make it less intimidating to ask questions Also this is where you go to get the problem sets To be clear these sessions are not replacements to attending lectures they are just supplements  Office Hours The professors and TAs clearly mention all of their office hours on Blackboard and on their lecture slides There are so a ton of office hours offered during the week and less people tend to attend these compared to the review sessions so if you prefer one on one help these are for you However make sure you come with specific questions because they will not simply go through the whole lecture like in the review session  Textbook Although recommended and required reading is assigned the exam and problem sets will prioritize concepts discussed in lecture For detailed multi step concepts and processes the textbook can supplement what you have learned in lecture with more detail and visuals This is especially true for processes such as replication transcription and translation Also although the course is lecture heavy the required reading is there for a reason and will probably be featured in a question or two on the exam Even if it is a concept discussed in lecture make sure you flip through the textbook explanation as well The beauty of this course is that no external resources are truly necessary in order to succeed All resources are already listed within the lectures or posted on Blackboard in order to allow for easy access The materials provided by the professors are more than enough to fully master the material of the course Other than lab reports there are no regular problem sets or weekly assignments for the class However MOL 214 is still an intensive class so you should be sure that you can keep up with the content on a regular basis and have time in your schedule to attend office hours and review sessions outside of the two 1 5 hour lectures and the 3 hour lab section The labs can also take more than the 3 hour period because one may need to come back during the week to either finish up an experiment or conduct necessary steps that must be carried out at a later time ",

            "text": "This class is a general survey of topics in environmental geochemistry Topics covered include the origin and formation of elements the evolution of atmospheric terrestrial and water systems material chemistry including ionic substitution in minerals organic and inorganic geochemistry reaction kinetics chemistry of water cycling and transport of nutrients and contaminants in terrestrial andbiological systems The course is organized in units that may eachinclude several topics Most of the unitsare interconnected though the earlier lectures tend to be more isolated in the larger scheme of the course Each unitis covered between 2 3 lectures Basic familiarity with chemistry is required as suggested by the prereqs of AP Chemistry or CHM 201 though specific nuances are explained in class if necessary The course is composed of two 80 minute lectures per week Each topic is covered by 2 3 lectures but one topic may be concluded and another begun in the same 80 min slot There are optional precepts offered at times when Professor Myneni feels that students may need additional background information for topics like organic chemistry for example The precepts follow the same general format as the regular lectures though there is less attendance and more opportunity to ask questions and discuss The lectures are delivered with PowerPoint slides though the slides are usually not text heavy but rather contain figures equations tables etc The material on the slides are supplemented with notes and additional examples and figures on the blackboard This course requires students to actively listen andtake note of key ideas which usually come from what is said or written on the blackboard Professor Myneni is usually good about communicating what the key take aways are but picking up these concepts requires careful listening of what is said in comment of the material on the slides He also pauses at times to ask conceptual questions and active participation in class is helpful in developing an intuition for the concepts covered At the beginning of every unit printed copies of the lecture slides are distributed to the class I found it helpful to take notes on the margins of these print outs so that I could identify which slide Professor Myneni was referencing when he said or wrote something on the board I took note ofeverything that was said or written on the blackboard that I thought could potentially be important and highlighted points thatProfessor Myneni indicated wereparticularly important Professor Mynenidoes not assign the reading until thebeginning of each unit The readings areusually good reference material especially for memorization heavy topics e g rules of ionic substitution if one needs to review the topics that have been or will becovered in lecture The texts areusually very straight forward but technical so it is not necessary to read sections that cover concepts and equations that you are familiar with except for the purpose of necessary review The assignments werecomposed of 3 4problem sets 5 6 quizzes 1 midterm and final both in class and a final group project that included a presentation Collaboration is not allowed on the problem sets In addition there was no TA in the course when I took it which required talking to the professor if I had any questions He was good about making himself available after class or by appointment which was helpful for completing the problem sets or clearing up concepts that were not well understood during lecture Often times there are several correct answers depending on what assumptions aremade to solve the problems so it can behelpfulto check with the professor if the assumptions that you make are reasonable Given that no collaboration is allowed the professor is helpful in giving you as much informationas you may need without leading you directly to the answer The quizzes are short 5 10 mins and just assessbasic concepts covered in each unit There are usually only 1 2 questions that require recall and or application of a concept to an unfamiliar situation Quizzesare often announced one class in advance and itwas useful to reread and rewrite notes from the unit being assessed1 2 daysbefore the quiz The midterm and final followed a similar format in relation to each other several questions broken down into different parts They require some memorization recall but emphasize the application of concepts to unfamiliar problems When studying for exams I found it helpful to review and rewrite all my notes from each unit covered in the exams and also redo some of the problems covered in problem sets or in class examples No past exams were provided for the purposes of studying The final group project is essentially a literature review followed by a presentation The professor distributes a list of possible topics gauges student interest in each topic and forms groups based on which students indicate preferences for whichtopics Research topics often have some connection to specific concepts covered in class but more so explore an application of these concepts in depth It is very helpful to arrange times to talk to the professor about unfamiliar concepts and questions regardingthe assignments after class for example He is usually very helpful and informative and provides more real world examples that enhance understanding of concepts At the conclusion of this course students can expect to have a basic understanding of many geochemical processes in natural environments Students will be able to solve problems with equations as well as predict how geochemical processes will proceed given certain environmental conditions It is worthwhile to note that this this class has a final exam AND final project so it might be heavy in terms of coursework near the end of the semester The topics that I understood the bestand became most interested in were those that I spoke to professor Myneni about after class or otherwise in search of clarification of ideas that were not clear to me initially Additionally the final project is a great opportunity to explore a current field of research in geochemistry especially if youre considering a related field for independent work JP or thesis ",

            "text": "As described in the Syllabus the course seeks to sketch the deep linkages between East Africa the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia by offering both a chronological and topical overview The coursehighlights the spread of religion Islam Buddhism the rise of colonialism importance of nationalism and third worldist movements and consequences of diasporic communities Each week Professor Laffan presents both a chronological and regional exploration of the above concepts with precepts seeking to connect these seemingly disparate topics and ideas The main goal of the course is to survey the ocean communities e g Mecca Zanzibar Calicut Ceylon etc and their prevalent role in an increasingly diverse interconnected and commercialworld Lectures Professor Laffan uses the lectures to contextualize and explore topics that are framed quite differently in traditional history classes Instead of providing a land based exploration of the key players in the course Professor Laffan describeseach disparate region and connects it to the Indian Ocean Not too subtly Professor Laffan also uses frequent question marks and wordplayin titles of his lectures to illustrate key points about the days theme and how an exploration via the Ocean piquesmuch more unique questions i e Anglo Indian or Indo Anglican Colonialism In my opinion this adds complexity to the course but also allows us to engage fully with the material presented Professor Laffan is also probably one of the most engaging and interactive professors with whom I have had the privilege of taking a course However be aware that the course can be a bit disorienting in the first couple of weeks until you find your bearing Professor Laffan also does not post his PowerPoints so attend all lectures they are also engaging and fun Precepts Precepts are handled and organize really well and serve as concrete methods of improving the connection between various topics and regions as previously mentioned the main connection between each region was faith power or the Indian Ocean itself Assigned readings ranged from time period narratives Memoirs of an Arabian Princess to more recent journal articles about the period International Dimensions of the 1965 68 Violence in Indonesia Just remember that much of these articles and readings will help you inform your understanding of the Indian Ocean arena and remember to draw on the themes that recur throughout the course Lecture Precept Preparation While you areresponsible forreadings forboth lecture and precept only the precept readings will be fully discussed although lecture readings are referenced in lectures and discussed briefly in precept although your Tuesday Lecture readings will form the basis of weekly response papers It iscritical that you read the materials assigned and be ready to discuss them in precept While not all preceptors utilized the format my preceptor also required each of us students to serve as preceptors and lead the discussion on the themes of the week Take notes for both precepts and lecture although a large bulkof the course will make sense only after completing the readings and synthesiszing the material The weekly schedule looks as follows Tuesday Lecture Reading Response due Thursday Lecture Precept On a weekly basis be ready to read 100 150 pages A few were challenging reads due to their dense academic analysis of historical events but I found them to be quite interesting Each week you will have a response paper 1 page front and back that succinctly analyzes and interprets an aspect of the Indian Ocean at a particular point in time Because you have different dimensions it is very important to be able to compartmentalize and organize information and be able to do so in your writing too This probably was the most difficult and taxing part of the course so spend time on it even though it is 1 page and I found that my best response papers were the ones that not only synthesized and contrasted the viewpoints of the reading but also to placethem to orientation with either previous readings or a broader theme e g The Hajj Utilize your syllabus as a way to understand where you are in the Indian Ocean story and be sure to keep track of important players in most cases these will be littoral communities city states or Empires as they have a tendency to reappear Create a study guide that captures not only the important faiths but also important powers for example instead of focusing on the muslim Mughal Empire as a standalone entity be ready to discuss and understand how their story connected with 1 the Indian Ocean 2 with other Powers across the Indian Ocean and 3 interacted with other faiths on shore and overseas This is probably the best way to distill the material and synthesize lecture precept and the readings I also helped to organize study groups both in our precept and with some of my fellow classmates from other precepts before our on demand midterm exam and the take home final This might be another great way to grapple with the material as many of your classmates might have also developed different insights and underlying connections Be excited and pumped to take this course regardless of class year or background It becomes clear why this course is so well reviewed The biggest challenge is orienting yourself to the format of the course which is unique in the way it is taught being ocean centric as opposed to land centric which can be a negative until you get it right Be ready to participate both in precept and in lecture for example on the first dayof class Professor Laffan asked teams of students to go to the blackboard anddrawour interpretation of what constituted the Indian Ocean arena Also be ready for a horizon expanding engaging experience in a high quality course Professor Laffan also tries to get to know the people in his lectureas much as possible and occasionally jokes aroundwith the auditors in class I could not more highly recommend this course It was a highlight of my sophomore year ",

            "text": "COS 226 is a prerequisite course for the Computer Science major and for the certificate This course will teach you about the most common known algorithms for sorting binary search substring search pattern matching in a text and other algorithms related to graph theory such as shortest path minimum spanning tree cycle identification etc This class will not ask you to come up with your own algorithms expect from during the midterm and the final exam in which case the algorithms you will come up with will be modifications of algorithms you have studied in class You will however be expected to analyze algorithms in terms of the running time vs memory tradeof The class also teaches some of the most important data structures such as symbol table hash table sets queue stack You will also analyze them in terms of which one is the most appropriate for a given task considering running time and memory The goals of the class in an increasing scale can be summarized as LectureAttending lecture is important because understanding how the algorithms work is way easier through an oral description than through a written one The demos during lecture which trace the algorithm are also very important to understand what the algorithm actually does Again tracing an algorithm through the pictures in the book is harder The lectures are very clear mostly the professor reads from the slides so they do not require anything extra other than paying attention It could be helpful to print the slides to follow them on paper and to take notes if you are finding it hard to concentrate To check for the students attendance the lectures also have little quizzes that you answer through an iClicker Although this is ungraded do try to think about the question because this however small interaction with the material being learned will enhance you understanding of the material Preparation for lecture beforehand is not necessary PreceptIn precept you do exercises that relate to the algorithms data structures just learned mostly tracing and to the assignment To make the most of the precept read the assignment beforehand and make sure you have at least a superficial understanding of the steps of an algorithm The exercises will then deepen your understanding of it It is important to engage actively with the exercises rather than waiting for the answer by the preceptor other student because you will both understand and memorize better AssignmentsYou will spend most of the time for this course doing the assignments which take approximately 10 12 hours In the assignment you implement the algorithms data structures you have learned about in lecture You are in a good shape to start the assignment after you have a clear understanding of how the algorithm data structure works after the lecture and precept You can receive a lot of help doing the assignments from lab TA s and office hours of preceptors however it will be more helpful if you do not over rely on these resources Before starting the assignment you will and should have a plan in mind about how you are going to proceed If you are not entirely sure about whether your idea will work expose your idea to a preceptor in office hours It has happened to me that after 2 hours of writing code based on an idea that was not well thought through in the beginning I realized that the idea would not work once I reached one of the functions we had to write Your code will most certainly contain bugs and some of them are quite interesting as to try to identify and resolve them by yourself rather than immediately seek help If you find that you are taking a long time to identify the bug then definitely seek help as it might just be a typing mistake to which your eyes have gotten too accustomed to be able to identify it ExamsThere is a midterm and final exam for the class The final will focus on the second half of the course The exams contain these types of questions Reading the book may not be necessary for the assignments however it is necessary if you want to have a deeper understanding of the algorithms learn how to analyze them and do well in the exams It would thus be ideal to allocate about 1 5 2 hours a week to reading the book Then before the exam reread the parts of the book that are more analytical the ones that discuss the properties of the algorithm rather than how the algorithm works Put down in your cheat sheet the running time and memory usage for each algorithm data structure The last two types of exercises reduction and algorithm design are the hardest ones in the exam The class does not prepare you directly for these types of questions If you want to prepare yourself throughout the course for these types of exercises then a good method is to do the highest level exercises from the study guide that the course provides Otherwise if you are preparing before the exam use the exercises from the past exams It is important to spend a long time thinking about the exercises to come up with your own answers rather than looking at the solutions as soon as you encounter hardship this is the only way to develop your own strategies about how to approach these more creative exercises Blackboard exercisesThis class also has 2 3 Blackboard exercises per lecture due every Sunday night These exercises mostly ask you to do algorithm tracing yes there is a lot of that in this class You have 3 trials and only the best score counts To save yourself time it is better to do the exercises carefully and slowly once rather then do them quickly 3 times Besides doing them carefully also double check before you submit one typo will cost you all of the points of the exercise In case you miss lecture then some YouTube videos with demos of algorithm tracing can help if you find it hard to follow the demos with pictures in the book This course is a prerequisite for the computer science major and certificate To take it you either need COS126 or to be comfortable programming in Java COS126 also gives an introduction to data structures such as stack queue and symbol table This class will explain all of the data structures from the beginning presupposing no knowledge but some familiarity with stack queue and symbol tables would be useful If you are debating between taking this class or COS 217 first my suggestion is that it is easier to continue programming in Java after you have just learned it in COS126 Moreover it is easier to switch to programming in C in COS217 once you know Java very well because the languages will not get muddled in your head However as the COS website will state any order is feasible and does not presuppose knowledge from the other course The course will take about 10 hours for the assignment and 3 hours for Blackboard exercises Time can vary a lot among students but I have found this to be the average time after talking to other students ",

            "text": "MAT 218 is the second part of the MAT216 218 introductory math sequence It continues as an introduction to the mathematical discipline of analysis and as preparation for other higher level math classes When compared with MAT216 218 focuses more on linear algebra topics and multi variable analysis Topics include real analytic mappings and series the Stone Weierstrass theorem endomorphisms inverse mapping theorem implicit functions integration over Jordan domains and Stokes Theorem The course is intended as a continuation of MAT216 Together the courses aim to provide students with a basic experience in a rigorous math class in a style that will be similar to the style that students will encounter in upper level math classes By the time students are in MAT 218 they have already had a semester of proof based mathematics and thus MAT 218 does tend to focus more on foundational concepts in math than MAT 216 does The class mainly focuses on linear algebra and multivariable calculus As such having some experience in both is helpful to contextualize the rigor and the proofs in the class although no background is assumed beyond what was covered in MAT 216 Professor Gunning usually covers material quite quickly during class Especially later in the course Professor Gunning will often skip small steps within proofs to present the big picture idea of how a proof is moving along As such it is important to follow both Professor Gunnings speech and his written work since sometimes he will say important things but not write them down or vice versa Professor Gunning does provide lots of examples of the material that he covers and usually has plenty of time to answer any questions from the class While Professor Gunning covers the majority of topics deeply in class there are topics that he skips over during class that are still important for a good understanding of the material presented in class A solid resource to rely in these cases or in general if lectures are confusing is Professor Gunnings compiled course notes which is essentially the textbook for the class If something is every confusing in lecture reading the textbook is usually a helpful and solid start since the lectures and the textbook generally cover identical material even including notation In order to make the best use of Professor Gunnings deep but fast lectures it is important that students have a good understanding of the material already covered Since lectures usually dont spend too much if any time on review and Gunning does not often connect theorems directly to each other not understanding what happened previously can lead to a scattered understanding of the material Understanding methods of proof is also essential since once a method of proof has been encountered once or twice the class will generally go over it only briefly skipping many of the small details As such it is important for students to have their own understanding of the proofs and the way they were proved After all while MAT 218 does present material that is new for some students the general purpose of the class is still to provide an introduction to mathematical thinking rather than teach a specific set of material To this end students should always remember to try and connect the various ideas that are presented in the class and figure out how they relate to each other While the material presented is useful the ability to link and understand mathematical concepts is far more important in a long term pursuit of mathematics Weekly assignments in MAT 218 are similar to what could be found in MAT 216 The assignments in general are challenging but teach students how to engage with increasingly theoretical material In general students should expect to spend a lot of time on the problem sets but with the assurance that the problem they encounter are very much within their abilities and do not require any outside knowledge Problem sets are almost entire proof based When approaching a problem set it is most helpful to first consider the proofs that have been shown in class and seeing what approaches worked and why Then it is also important particularly in analysis to go over definitions and basic concepts to try and get a better grasp of what the problem is saying Finally it is usually instructive to try and solve a simpler version of the problem or to do some numerical examples to see why a particular statement would be true Exams are generally similar to the problem sets although shorter and easier due to the three hour time limit Although they are open note students should have a solid understanding of the material before the exam Since the exam like the problem sets are mostly proofs looking up definitions or theorems could detract from time spent thinking about the proofs Since MAT 218 is still introductory content the internet can serve as a valuable resource Wikipedia in particular stands out The math pages are generally quite well written and seeing statements and proofs from another angle can be illuminating The math department also offers problem sessions that are taught by upperclassmen Even when the problem sessions dont cover a specific question that a student might have it is usually instructive to listen to classmates and tutors explain how to think about different problems and proofs Professor Gunnings office hours are also great He is very open to questions and generally responds with hints that do not fully explain the problem but give the student good insight and intuition into it MAT218 has a very theoretical bend and requires MAT216 as a pre requisite As such it is mainly intended for those students who are seriously considering studying rigorous math in the future Although it is usually taken by freshmen looking to concentrate in math there are also computer science and physics students who take the class to gain a better grasp of rigorous thinking and of underlying mathematical concepts MAT218 along with MAT216 is definitely one of the most time intensive and demanding pre requisite courses at Princeton It is however very well taught and rewarding and a memorable experience for any student considering the deeper pursuit of mathematics ",

            "text": "The goal of the fall 2015 LIN 201 course with Professor Fellbaum is to provide an introduction to the scientific analysis of language including its structure and uses The course aims to give students an understanding of both the systematicity of language and the variation that exists within and across languages The course is divided into 12 weekly units which often build on each other The first half of the course up until the midterm covers the core foundational areas of linguistics phonetics phonology morphology syntax semantics and pragmatics Once students have a solid foundation in these areas the course extends to new more abstract topics including first and second language acquisition language variation and change writing systems language processing and disorders language evolution and computational approaches to language The course flows by quickly as a new unit is discussed each week Lectures and readings serve to teach the basics of each topic while problem sets put this information into action by exploring and analyzing authentic data from a wide range of languages and language types Because the course is fast paced all the foundational concepts build off each other and these concepts are required to understand the later sections of the course it is easy for a student to quickly become lost if they do not keep up with the material To prevent this from happening it is important to review the lecture slides and readings the day after each lecture and make sure each new unit is understood in detail Although this course moves at a quick pace no specific background knowledge is required as the foundational concepts are covered in the first half of the course However analysis of language data tends to be very mathematical and requires strong logic capabilities to find hidden patterns in the data so make sure you are confident in these areas Lecture occurs twice a week precept is held once a week and there are weekly readings and biweekly problem sets Lecture and readings cover the same material while precepts and problem sets apply this material to analyze language data Lectures are usually slide shows with sparse text that the professor uses to emphasize her points as she speaks Because the slides do not have so much text it is necessary to take detailed notes during lecture This can sometimes be difficult because laptops are not allowed in lecture so the textbook readings can be used to supplement any gaps in the notes Lectures introduce new material on each slide at a fast pace so it is important to listen carefully and make sure the main point of each new slide is understood To efficiently prepare for lecture it is recommended to read the assigned textbook chapters ahead of time Precepts meet once each week Instead of going over the same information as from lecture precepts apply the concepts to practice problems similar to those in the biweekly problem sets Each precept works carefully through about 4 5 of these problems During each problem the preceptor shares techniques and tricks to help analyze language data effectively and quickly determine patterns and similarities among different languages It is important to pay attention during precept as this information is extremely helpful in determining how to approach the problem sets which are given out at the end of precept and due the week after The preceptor is happy to repeat any step in the problem if you require further explanation so do not hesitate to ask for help While laptop use is allowed in precept it is recommended to take notes by hand as many of the problems require drawing complex diagrams to help analyze the data Make sure to bring the textbook to precept as data from the textbook is used for most of the practice problems and it can serve as a good reference as well Weekly readings are assigned in the accompanying textbook The Language Files This is a great textbook that explains everything in clear and simple language so make sure to make use of this valuable asset These readings usually cover the same material as the lectures However it is important to read the textbook either before or after lecture to make sure each new concept is understood in totality as notes from lecture can be incomplete because they have to be taken by hand The textbook also goes into greater detail than the lectures on a few topics so it is usually necessary to read to be able to solve the problem sets The textbook is also a useful reference to help understand the problem sets because at the end of each section it gives advice on how this information can be applied to linguistics analysis problems Furthermore the textbook includes detailed solutions to a few exercise problems and these are very helpful for the problem sets When reading the textbook it is recommended to underline or highlight key points of each section so they can be easily found again when doing the problem sets I would recommend memorizing the phonetic and vowel tables in the back of the textbook as it is useful for the problem sets and must be memorized for the midterm Problem sets are due approximately every other week totaling to four problem sets throughout the semester The questions on the problem sets are based off of the material covered in lecture and the textbook but much thought and logic is required to apply these concepts to solve these problems Therefore it is necessary to pay close attention to the problem solving tips taught in precept and in a few sections of the textbook At first the problem sets can seem challenging but over time it becomes much easier to find logical connections and patterns in the tables of language data Problem sets can take up to 8 hours to completely solve the problems and write up the solutions so make sure to start working on these assignments early Group work is not allowed on the problem sets but if you completely understand the textbook and lecture notes the problem sets should not be too difficult In addition to the problem sets there is a midterm and a take home final Both tests consist of problems that are very similar to those on the problem sets Therefore the best way to study for these tests is to review the lecture and textbook material and then redo the problem sets to make sure you completely understand the problem solving process behind the solutions to these questions The midterm is in class so phonetic classifications must be memorized or else the problems on the test will be impossible The midterm occurs halfway through the course and covers all the basic introductory material to the course If you review all this material and the problem sets related to it then the midterm should be completely manageable The take home final is open book so no memorization is necessary to prepare for the final although it is important to thoroughly review all the course material so you are familiar with all the types of problems seen on the final and how to approach them Because the final is take home it is much longer than the problem sets and the midterm Make sure to plan ahead to allocate at least a full day to working on the final so that you have time to properly write up each solution in detail I did not use any external resources besides office hours for this course While the problem sets and take home final are open book referring to anything but the textbook and lecture notes is prohibited However both were great resources and I could always find the information I needed in either the lecture notes or the textbook In addition to the written materials the preceptors and professor were very happy to meet and discuss any questions about course material problem sets or answer more general questions about the course I would really recommend meeting with one of the teachers if you are confused about any topic because they clearly explained to me any topic I was confused about so I always left more comfortable with the course material Definitely take LIN 201 if you are looking for a well rounded introduction to the basics of linguistics I took LIN 201 because I was interested in pursuing a Linguistics certificate and I have definitely left with a better sense of how linguistic analysis works and will most likely be doing the certificate I wish I had known how fast paced the course is so I would have worked harder at the beginning of the semester to review all the important material to make sure I completely understood the fundamental concepts that the rest of the course is based on I would recommend taking this course either freshman or sophomore year if you are trying to decide whether to pursue a linguistics certificate so that you will have time to fulfill the rest of the certificates requirements While the course can be challenging at times the workload is relatively light so this could be a good course to take if you know the rest of your courses will be very time consuming The workload also lessens a bit towards the end of the semester which is helpful as it is usually the opposite for most classes As each problem set counts for 10 of the course grade make sure to check them over carefully as getting one problem wrong can change your overall grade by quite a bit This course does not assume any previous knowledge so you do not have to worry about feeling behind anyone else in the class Anyone who works hard and utilizes the resources around them will have a chance to do well in the course Good luck ",

            "text": "This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of hydrology or the study of the movement of land and atmospheric water The focus is predominantly mathematical with some discussion of historical water management as well The majority of in class instruction about 80 is mathematical focused on the derivation of equations of water motion using physics high school level statistics and basic physical modeling The mathematics of the course does not go above multivariable calculus MAT 201 or MAT 175 should be sufficient as prerequisites The textbook for this part of the course available on Blackboard has 6 chapters each introducing a different set of equations The mathematical content is ordered in terms of increasing modeling complexity with conservation of mass equations and simple physics ex the Ideal Gas Law Raoults Law at the beginning and thermodynamic heat transfer equations ex Clausius Clapeyron toward the end The content also increases in detail with the latter chapters introducing more specificand igorous models with fewer assumptions The remainder of course instruction the majority of precepts and some lecture time focused on the history of water systems in the US the Mississippi River the Colorado River and the Columbia river among others Prof Smith led the precepts in a discussion style talking about the ethics politics effectiveness and long term sustainability of water management focusing on one water system per week Anyone with the required background in mathematics to take this course should find the math straightforward plug and chug The difficulty lies in knowing when to apply the equations and understanding their derivation For example the following difficulty was common in one problem students were given a list of rain droplet diameters in a rainstorm and solving the problem required calculation of the average rain droplet volume Some students correctly solved the problem by finding the volume of each rain drop in the sample and averaging while others incorrectly averaged the diameters then found the volume using the average The best way to deal with conceptual difficulties and learning how to apply the equations particularly for those with less physics engineering background would be to go to office hours and discuss the problem sets Most students who take this course are CEE upperclassmen however so most of the content is straightforward for engineering students Lecture focuses almost exclusively on the derivation of equations for water movement The notes present the equations but significantly less derivation than we do in class The best way to absorb material is to the read the notes before lecture so you understand the goals of each class session As discussed earlier precepts go over the readings on water systems also on Blackboard It is important to do these readings in order to be able to contribute to classroom discussion note that we do not discuss the mathematical aspects of class during these precepts Two of the precepts toward the end of the semester are designated as lab sessions they are the same length as a precept 1 hour except they take place in the CEE computer lab Both labs introduce students to GSSHA or geisha a drainage basin modeling software tool The labs do not require any previous knowledge students are given explicit instruction for each step and the lab assignments are not particuarly difficult nor is the knowledge required for any other aspect of the course The problem sets have two types of questions quantitative intended to teach you how to apply class equations and short answer focusing on the water system readings The best way to prepare for the problem sets is by paying attention in class and doing both the math and drainage basin reading as well as following the prep for the exam questions described below This class has one midterm exam during class and a standard three hour written final exam Both exams are predominantly quantitative with one essay question analyzing the water systems The quantitative questions are similar to the problem set questions the best way to practice for these would be to do well on the problem sets and attend office hours since there are no practice problems for the exams and there is little outside material most outside sources such as Wikipedia or other hydrology textbooks use different notation and procedure so these are little help The best way to study for the water system questions would be to take careful notes during precept The professor discusses explicitly the most important topics and due to the short precept time there is not a great depth of material so knowing it thoroughly is key The lab assignment is interesting and a good introduction to the software but is a small part of the class and is relatively straightforward As discussed earlier most outside sources such as Wikipedia or other hydrology textbooks use different notation and procedure so these are little help Some students may still find parts of these sources useful for example the Wikipedia article on the atmospheric boundary layer For the most part studying the course material should be sufficient Students should expect to learn modeling of water systems and how to apply this knowledge as well as gain an introduction to the intersection of politics economics sustainability and ethics in water management policy This course would be most useful for those intending to work in an environmental field and builds on the skills developed in CEE and to a lesser degree Geosciences Students in other majors may find the course interesting but not directly applicable The course has a relatively small time demand Readings take about 30 45 minutes per week and the problem sets take roughtly 1 3 hours depending on your background As a CBE major while I may never apply the information learned in this course it encouraged me to enter the environmental track of CBE and the modeling skills and policy review were enjoyable and a nice introduction to another field of engineering ",

            "text": "The course provides a hands on introduction to the use of laboratory techniques for processing and characterization in materials science Structure property relations will be explored through experiments concerning electronics mechanical testing optical testing polymerization and microfluidics The underlying theories behind thelab techniques will be explained in biweekly lectures Topics include electronic and mechanical properties electron microscopy electron diffraction materials processing polymer chemistry The goal of this course is for the student to develop a solid understanding of materials properties the common techniques used in research the theory behind the techniques as well as the opportunity to perform these techniques The course is partitioned into 4 sections each led by a different professor who lectures and designs lab assignments based on his field of expertise Note that professors leading the course varies year from year On a big picture scale the materials in the first two sections Sturm ELE and Yao MSE focus on hard materials with some overlap in their course while the latter two sections Priestley CBE and Vyawahare PHY are independent of one another and of the first half Sturm and Yao focus on the material processing and characterization of solar cells Priestley focuses on soft material polymer fabrication and characterization Vyawahare focuses on microfluidics and their applications to biological research The modular nature of the course may make the course challenging with the quick turn over time between sections Additionally concepts may bridge multiple sections thus the course requires thorough understanding of the material Due to the nature of material science and the diverse faculty members who teach this course it would be to ones benefit to have knowledge from a variety of fields This however is not entirely necessary to do well in the course It would be very helpful to have taken either MSE 301 or MAE 324 the pre requisites for this course The course draws from photovoltaics optics polymer chemistry rheology fluid mechanics etc Basic physics and chemistry is sufficient Knowing how to use excel or Matlab will be beneficial for the lab reports Lectures and lab seem separate at times but they certainly are connected Each professor has his own method of lecturing and it may be either refreshing or frustrating to have a new lecturer each session The lectures are generally more theoretical and little time is dedicated to explaining the lab procedures and the lab experiments Not everything in the lecture is necessary to complete the lab reports Frequently the information in he lectures will go into much more depth than needed Additionally the lectures might not all be directly related to the labs The professors will also present recent advancements in the field or their own research All lectures are presented by power point The board may be used to go over derivations of equations The labs are run mostly by AIs TAs and depending on the lecturer he may also be present Professor Yao and Vyawahare essentially split the lab work with their AIs Generally lab will not require you stay past the allocated time Data is generally collected as a group therefore data is often pooled Lab reports do not require additional textbook or paper reading but such additional reading may be beneficial Vyawahares section is an exception as his lab work requires looking up literature Homework may be assigned but if it is assigned it is to gear students thinking in the direction of the lab report In the labs there are not always answers since the experiments may be incomplete in design Therefore due to incomplete data might be something new that students need to accept Lab reports generally take more time than expected and often require collaboration with classmates Though under utilized the AIs are helpful as are the professors Attending office hours or asking to meet to review the lab report is almost just as important as lecture The course is almost entirely lab reports The final is a presentation on a lab technique of the students own choosing Lab reports vary greatly in time investment difficulty vagueness and time investment required Lab reports do not build upon one another and therefore it is difficult to learn from one lab report and apply it to another This fact is made even more difficult by the fact that different professors emphasize different components of a lab report It is best to clarify with the professor and AI before exerting too much on one component The main function of these lab reports is to use the knowledge given during class and solve the open ended questions presented by the lab assignments to the best of ones abilities At times the professors will not know what the answer is either but the report really pushes the student to think critically about he problem at hand Since a majority of the grade in the class I based on laboratory reports and given the vagueness of some of the reports it is important to start early and try to find how concepts in the lectures may be significant to the report Starting early will allow students to think about the problem slowly and gather more information on the subject during lectures Another significant aspect of this course is asking the professors to clarify he bounds of the question they have posed The questions are geared to assess students ability to think critically but some of the questions posed may simply be open questions to see students thought processes Lastly collaboration is key for success in this class The course at varying points will cover topics that only some students from different departments will have taken Therefore collaboration brings different viewpoints from different disciplines together to solve problems Additionally looking at literature is helpful since many of the lab problems posed are related to recent or even current problems in the field of study The presentation at the end of the semester is a good way to explore a new topic and practice presenting science in an easy and approachable manner The presentation needs to be related to material characterization and should relate to the course in some way This assignment is in liu of a final exam and deans date assignments The presentation test the students ability to communicate effectively and to teach fellow students about a new techniques Questions will also be asked to test students abilities to think critically on the spot For this last assignment students should find something genuinely interesting that they may speak on Again working ahead is advised and very importantly students should ask professors what they are seeking in their presentation Certain topics may be in themselves entire courses and therefore students should seek to clarify with professors what is important to be covered To conclude to stay atop of the work early since many difficulties to arise in answering vague questions Starting early allows students to also gauge the vagueness of the problem and hopefully give them the opportunity to clarify what is expected of the student Lastly collaboration is key to solve the interdisciplinary problems posed by the reports Web resources and journal articles may be a good sources for additional reading No reading was assigned or provided as external resources unless asked for by the student The external resources of the course were sought by students entirely on their own volition Students should expect to learn about the theory behind laboratory techniques and be active in class and lab the course is small and therefore participation is crucial for learning The lab techniques will be helpful for future work that requires material fabrication processing and characterization Most importantly for students interested in pursuing independent work in CBE MAE ELE or CHM this course will provide a well rounded understanding of common techniques Since this is a core laboratory course expect time commitment to be substantial Would not recommend taking this course with another laboratory class simply due to hours needed to spend in class The class is also lacking in organization and prepare to cope with uncertainty Due to the interdisciplinary field of material science the course will push students to expand their science repertoire All fields of science technology engineering and mathematics will be utilized in this course",

Perfect Equilibria are introduced in the context of dynamic games of perfect information Dynamic games of perfect information include the Stackelberg model of duopoly sequential bargaining and repeated games Then the concept and derivation of Bayesian Nash Equilibria are presented in the context of static games of incomplete information These games include various types of auctions Lastly

understand the logic behind these techniques from the beginning These skill and ways of thinking the classes teaches include the following the logic behind a Nash equilibrium and how to find it the idea of backward induction and the technique of using probability and Bayes rule with other game theoretic tools to find equilibria in static and dynamic games with incomplete information

place where the new information is presented theories and techniques for solving different types of games how they are derived and how to use them The lectures provide great opportunities for acquiring an understanding of where game theoretic thinking comes from and how to apply it for solving problems Every time a new topic is introduced the process follows the same structured and logical process introduction of new terms and definitions description of the problem the approach for solving the problem and proving that the approach indeed works Furthermore example problems are presented and solved and the students have an opportunity to ask questions and ensure that they understand the technique and the reason behind it and that they can also apply this knowledge for problem solving Precepts and office hour provide additional opportunities to clarify questions ensure understanding and provide access to additional application and further implications of the topics taught The course book and other recommended text can be use as a supplement or as a substitution to the lectures The overall goal of the class is to enable students to acquire the necessary understandings and problem solving skills to be able to solve a range of game theoretic problems Therefore the assignments are a crucial part of the class and of learning The assignments provide the opportunity to put the newly acquired knowledge to use and to check whether the understanding is sufficient for application Additionally the problem sets are a great preparation for the exams as both types of assessments require the same skill sets and underlying understandings Following along the lectures and understanding the theories and methods and why they work are essential preparation for the assignments At the same time the assignments provide feedback about whether the learning has taken place Therefore the assignments and the lectures complement each other well to achieve the goal of the class teaching usable and enduring understanding and skills for approaching game theoretic problems For further questions and topics more advanced game theory books and articles mentioned in class can be a good resource For additional practice additional questions in the textbook and recommended books can be helpful In general office hours and talking to the professor and the preceptor can be a good way to access external resources This is one of those type of economics classes that involves more math and is problem set heavy However what is great about this class is that it requires more math than simply being able to take derivatives It brings together probability economics and real life in an exciting and challenging way The class is rigorous but at the same time manageable if one has a background in math and or logical thinking and problem solving skills If that is the case what is great about this class is that the problem sets require not only knowing the basic tools and methods learnt in class but also actual thinking beyond manipulating equations or dealing with boring and annoying calculations This is one of those kinds of classes where preparing for exams is either a straightforward process if one understands the methods how to use them and how to approach the problems or otherwise a long and troublesome one The class gives a solid introduction to game theory and in general to more theoretical economics at the level close to that of a graduate level class It can be a great experience for economics majors considering a theoretical thesis and or applying to graduate school At the same time this class can also be interesting for math majors looking for something more applicable than pure math classes ECO 310 and ECO 321 Industrial Organizations are good preparations for this class there are some minor overlaps and generally a similar feel to the class but on a more advanced level Without having taken any of those too it is still very much manageable Nevertheless a background in probability is highly recommended Without a reasonable math and probability background consider taking the game theory class offered by the politics department instead With a stronger background in math and interest in the theory of it mostly consider taking the game theory class offered by the math department ",

            "text": "The main intention of Environmental Geochemistry GEO 363 is to familiarize students with the chemical reactions that 1 formed and 2 continue to shape the Earth In order to accomplish this the semester is broken down into three main units Unit 1 Evolution of the Universe and Origin of Elements This first unit which comprises the first few weeks of the semester aims to familiarize students with key physical and to some extent chemical processes that led to the formation of the galaxy solar system and Earth Among the concepts discussed the crucial one is elemental abundance Most of the content presented in this unit stems directly from this concept 1 how the relative abundances of light elements like hydrogen in the very early universe led to the formation of stars and determines their life cycles 2 how nuclear processes like fusion fission and explosive star death cause certain elements to be more abundant in the Universe than others and 3 how differing elemental densities caused nebulas to condense into a present day solar system with characteristic elemental profiles Expectations on students in this unit include mathematically balancing nuclear reactions like fusion fission and alpha beta positron decay and students who are shaky on this topic may want to practice from online example problems Unit 2 Introduction to Materials Chemistry of the Earth Surface This second units emphasis is to build up a library of conceptual tools in chemical analysis that will later be applied to modern geological phenomena in the third unit The chemical composition of various minerals is also discussed among these clay minerals calcite aragonite and hydroxyapatite reappear frequently throughout the semester and should therefore be mastered in great detail People with a strong chemistry background may be lulled into a false sense of security by familiar concepts like hydrophilic hydrophobic interactions equilibrium constants and reduction potentials but Dr Myneni also brings in many new geochemistry exclusive concepts like humin humic acids Eh pH diagrams and ionic activity products IAPs that must be studied with care Students without a strong chemistry background should especially take advantage of Dr Mynenis special help sessions on topics like organic chemistry equilibrium constants and the balancing of chemical reactions since the problem sets revolve around the rigorous application of these concepts to geochemical systems Among the concepts presented the two debatably most important concepts are metal ion coordination which determine the structure of minerals and substitution of impurities into them and acid base aqueous chemistry which determines the weathering and solubility of many mineralsmany weathering reactions make water more basic by consuming H these two concepts will reappear very frequently in the third unit Reduction oxidation chemistry is a significant third topic reappearing in some third unit topics like the origins of the atmosphere and seas modern compositions Unit 3 Biogeochemistry of the Continental Marine and Atmospheric Systems This unit represents the real meat of the course applying concepts developed in the second unit to real life systems like rocks and soils streams lakes oceans and the atmosphere The evolution of these systems will also be explored Throughout the unit it is important to focus on the way in which Unit 2 concepts act as driving forces to bring about the geological patterns observedfor instance differences in solubility reactions for silicates and aluminum oxides cause minerals like bauxite to accumulate in regions of high weathering while clay minerals and other silicates are washed away A number of profiling systems and terminology i e soil composition profiles thermal lake depth profiles salinity will be introduced to classify differing land and aquatic environments and these terms and definitions must be studied in depth as preparation for the exam material In addition to these three lecture material units students are also required to complete a group literature survey project that involves two major components 1 a group presentation and 2 an individual 4 page paper The main purpose of the project is to deepen the groups understanding of a specific topic like the weathering of buildings or the impact of a specific environmental pollutant through research Students are also expected to narrow their focus from the more general project title and thus the project encourages students to be independent thinkers and identify a topic of interest from within a larger body of information However the project is also intended to build skills in collecting and synthesizing information from scientific journals and articles Students need to take early ownership of their projects and quickly dive into the research project in order to identify a topic of choice a task that is facilitated by required regular progress reports to Dr Myneni Depending on the situation may be efficient to delegate specific sub topics to different group members but the final paper requires each individual to have a solid understanding of all the sources found It may be helpful to provide summaries of articles and prepare PowerPoint slides in GoogleDocs In addition to ones own presentation it is vital to pay close attention to the presentations of the other groups In the past Dr Myneni has included a section on the exam where students must answer questions about material presented by other groups Lectures are the main source of information in the class Dr Myneni prepares PowerPoint presentations for each lecture but he also presents a significant amount of material exclusively on the chalkboard The content of the PowerPoints is provided to students via printouts of the lecture slides but Dr Myneni does not provide electronic access to the PowerPoints so attendance is absolutely crucial to ensure students have access to all the information they need Students should not go into lecture with the expectation that the handouts are sufficient sources of information many slides contain only pictures and should elaborate on them with Dr Mynenis chalkboard notes and words either on the handouts or in a separate notebook Based on personal experience the readings provided as electronic PDFs were most useful for their tables and chemical data on relevant homework assignments to students who learn well through text or are having trouble understanding the concepts in lecture however the readings may be useful for review All the content on assignments and exams is taken directly from the lectures so comprehensive lecture notes should be sufficient for study When studying for quizzes and exams it is especially important to keep this principle in mind unlike many courses the amount of time Dr Myneni spends discussing a subtopic is NOT ALWAYS RELATED to its emphasis on examination material While concepts that Dr Myneni spends a great deal of time talking about will almost certainly be covered on examinations Dr Myneni also enjoys creating exam and quiz questions on very surprisingly specific topics like the terminology used to classify stars elements soils rivers or lakes even if he only mentioned them for less than a minute in class His goal is to make sure students develop a deep understanding of the entire course material so when studying it is critical to make sure you understand every lecture slide especially labels and terms on diagrams Problem Sets The problem sets in GEO 363 tend to be more numerically focused than the lectures or even to some extent quizzes exams They often entail calculation heavy problems like equilibria equations or creating acid solubility plots While these problems are partially intended to give students an appreciation of the quantitative side to many concepts that are otherwise discussed on a very conceptual and qualitative level these problem sets often end with requests for qualitative prediction that require students to employ higher level conceptual thinking skills At some level the raw numbers can obfuscate the principles they represent and the trick to succeeding on the assignments is to learn to look past the numbers and keep track of the physical parameters they represent to make predictions about the behavior of a system Paper and PowerPoint Presentation The paper that culminates the independent project is intended to ensure students have digested all of the information discovered by their group and can articulate and summarize it in the context of academic writing Like the problem sets independent thinking and making predictions are important for proposing future research and discussing the sources critically however the main emphasis of the independent project is taking ownership of all the research performed by the group and being able to communicate it to others Finding a few sources on a very specific topic may be effective for preparing the PowerPoint presentation where each member can act as experts on narrow subtopics in the context of a larger group presentation However students who take this approach may quickly run into problems when the report requires them to discuss papers that were found and vetted by other group members Within the group students should be continually communicating the information they have learned from each source being briefed on the articles in advance makes it easier to process the articles on your own when writing the paper later A personally successful strategy was to maintain a Google Doc where each group member posted summaries of the articles they read as well as their citation information Tests including exams and quizzes Dr Mynenis tests and quizzes are in a standard open answer format with each quiz having one question and the tests having around ten to twelve Quizzes are given right at the end of lecture warning sometimes they may run over time so be careful about scheduling things tightly after class their intention is to ensure students are processing information from the lectures throughout the course instead of cramming everything right before the midterm and final These quizzes will always be announced well in advance and Dr Myneni rarely if ever neglects to mention which lecture they will be based from As described above all the content on the exams is presented in the lectures so studying from Dr Mynenis slides and comparing them to your own notes is often the best strategy You should also know how to perform the tasks from the problem sets although the lecture material is often more of a focus Because there is a lot of content and a higher than average amount of memorization involved you may find it helpful to create a study guide that highlights the important or most troublesome topics in the material This will allow you to quickly rehearse and test yourself on content at a glance The quiz and test questions will evaluate your conceptual understanding of terms and definitions and also make sure you can perform critical thinking tasks with them i e predicting the impact of a pollutant or how to control it The questions he ask may not necessarily be limited to the key concepts as mentioned above questions may have a very narrow focus at times and therefore it is important to understand every concept and term presented in lecture unless Dr Myneni explicitly says otherwise Much of the material presented in lecture is pictorial in nature so drawing diagrams on test questions will aid memory and help to demonstrate your knowledge Because Dr Mynenis lecture notes are almost completely comprehensive there isnt a large need to locate resources outside of the course To reiterate Dr Mynenis help sessions are useful for people unfamiliar with concepts like balancing chemical reactions or equilibrium constants Dr Myneni also is very accommodating during office hours and will entertain almost any question about the material research project or problem sets There were only a few times where I missed a definition for a term presented in the lecture slides etc and in all of these cases a simple Google search was enough to clarify the matter I highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the environment or the chemical processes that continually shape the Earth This is not a course you can just breeze through without effort but its very well organized and every bit of effort you put in is thoroughly rewarded Dr Mynenis lecture and testing style is very intelligently designed and caused me to learn an incredible amount about the Earth over the course of the semester Ive also become much more environmentally aware something really crucial for an academic laboratory chemist The best takeaway I received from the course has been a detailed mental model of Earths geochemical processes and environment based on what Ive learned I can now anticipate the likely effects that various human choices can have on the environment when presented with themthis course is great for people interested in environmental policy as well as researchers who want to anticipate the impacts of their new materials and chemicals on the Earth Dr Myneni may occasionally throw curveballs on some exam questions in the sense that he sometimes asks about surprisingly specific concepts that were only briefly discussed in class but he is always very explicit about his expectations and very willing to help people who take the time to talk to him His expectations are high but it caused me to put in solid effort to rise to them because the course is so well run I think I learned about three times as much from his course as some higher level chemistry courses Ive taken It does take time to study the concepts in the required level of detail but I never found it overwhelming and the workload was actually less than many more commonly taken courses The independent project is also really valuable for building research skills in scientific disciplines and is a nice way to wrap up the course As long as you go into the course with the resolve to learn actively you will do fine ",

            "text": "Lecture Two 50 minute lectures a week delivered by Professor Burnham Professor Burnhams lecture style was often humorous and engaging and during lecture he would generally discuss the styles and composers of each music period we were looking at and present analyses of the music excerpts we were required to identify The chief challenge of lecture is that he did not always adhere to a strict outline in his discussions so the information he presented us with could seem useless or desultory A useful tip for lecture is to always keep in mind what the broader theme time period was and to fit each particular piece of information into that broader context Textbook We didnt have required readings from the textbook but the textbook served as a supplement to lecture information and accompanied a CD that contained the excerpts we were expected to recognize on the midterm and final There is no need to go through the entire textbook systematically but it could be helpful if there was an element in lecture one was confused about The most important component of the textbook was the glossary in back which contained terms we were expected to know for exams Precepts Precepts consisted of going over material from lecture and frequently involved analyzing pieces of music the preceptor would play for us we were not required to know these While the preceptor would make precept interactive by asking questions of the students precept did not feature open discussion as precepts in many other humanities courses do The key to precept as simple as this sounds was to go to lecture and pay attention It would have been much harder to participate in precept without knowing the lecture information The class was 30 class participation 30 midterm and 40 final Class participation consists of 20 precept participation and 10 writing assignments The writing assignments were a mixture of analysis listening to a piece of music provided by the instructors and answering questions about it and concert review going to a concert on campus and writing a review on it In more detail Tests including exams and quizzes Both the midterm and final were divided into four parts The first part consisted of identifying and answering questions on music excerpts we had been introduced to in class The instructors would play the excerpt and we would be required to state what it was who composed it what period it was from and answer some follow up questions on it To prepare for this part I simply made a list of every piece of music in the class and listened to them over and over again until I knew title composer period I would also read up on other facts about the piece from lecture and from the textbook We also had to answer questions about one excerpt we had not been exposed to using principles we had learned in class The first question was typically about identifying the style of music that the piece belonged to This was the most difficult part of both the midterm and the final Part III of the exams consisted of being given a description or definition of some term from class and being asked to supply the term in question I prepared for this part by going to the glossary in the back of the textbook and reviewing the words and definitions over and over again until I knew them Part IV of the exams were essay question s I didnt really prepare for this part specifically and felt that going over the terms and excerpts of music prepared me to write the essays In general the exams tested straightforward recall from the lectures and so reviewing was a matter of memorization However there was also some application to new situations such as the unfamiliar excerpt Class participation Going to precept each week and answering questions I found that simply going to lecture and paying attention to lecture enabled me to answer questions in precept Writing assignments A mixture of concert reviews and music analysis assignments They were short about a page each and were graded based on submission so they werent very stressful but Ill talk a little here about the strategies I used for doing them The concert reviews were of University organized concerts in Richardson Auditorium such as PUO concerts I had to write up a description of what the music was that was played what strategies or techniques the performers used and what I thought the strengths and weaknesses were The key here was to be alert and outline the response during the concert the review would have been much more difficult to write if I hadnt done that because I would have forgotten what happened The analysis assignments consisted of a provided music excerpt and a list of questions to answer Questions would be about the structure of the music and the techniques the artist used In general I did not make too much use of external resources in this class McGraw does not offer study help for MUS 103 and I dont think the Writing Center would have been too much use for the written assignments as they were pretty short and informal Here are the resources I did use Wikipedia Should not be used as a substitute for the lectures or the textbook but can be useful if one needs to quickly verify a fact on a composer or time period YouTube There is a CD accompanying the textbook with the required pieces of music but you can also just listen to the pieces on YouTube An efficient way of becoming very familiar with the music is to listen to it while youre doing other workthis way you can get to know the pieces while also getting your other work done This survey course is not a music departmental and will not be of particular assistance with independent work but it will give students who take it a broad understanding of music history starting with the Middle Ages and ending in the present day Students will know what the major periods of music were such as the Classical period Romantic period etc what the defining features and styles of each period were and what the most famous composers compositions were from each period They will be able to identify composers that may not have been familiar before such as Antonin Dvorak or Franz Joseph Haydn and they will also be able to identify pieces of music that may not have been familiar to them before such as Dvoraks New World Symphony For students who have had previous exposure to classical music and so will already be familiar with the composers pieces that are covered the course will give historical context to this knowledge and potentially build on it by introducing pieces composers with which the student was not familiar As someone who played classical music since elementary school this contextualization was the courses most valuable benefit to me This class did not have much weekly work beyond attending class and preceptthere were no papers or Deans Date assignments and the music analysis concert review papers took only about a couple hours each The bulk of the work was preparing for the midterm and final which involved a fairly time consuming process of listening to all the excerpts and making notes about them as well as studying terms and definitions Note that even if you were P D Fing the exams would still have required some preparation because the questions all had a right or wrong answer and so a student who knew very little of the material would get a failing grade One other major item of note is that with this class as with all Princeton classes who is in the class is as important as the subject matter in determining how difficult the class will be This class is known as Clapping for Credit and has many students in it who are taking it because theyre looking for an easy class or a not too time consuming fifth class and students frequently P D F However there are also students in the class who had previous exposure to classical music and so would have had an advantage And the course while not particularly difficult and very light on workload is not a joke as the clapping for credit name suggests and should not be blown off ",

            "text": "This course is designed to be an introduction to digital logic and its uses in computing The low level architecture of a computer is covered from individual transistor arrangements up to the design of a full processor Along the way components are discussed in increasing order of complexity with additional layers of abstraction being used to keep it comprehensible For example Boolean algebra and logic gates are discussed first such as AND and OR gates because those are the foundations of digital logic This allows for the construction of combinational logic circuits which do not run with a clock After that unit however sequential logic is introduced which does run with a clock That allows for arrangements of these gates to be discussed for building datapath components including adders or multiplexors With datapath components the controller and datapath can then be established as separate systems that work concurrently to make a processor Optimization is covered at the end and discusses the space time power tradeoff that goes into design decisions General engineering strategies and practices are also taught including design by composition which emphasizes managing complexity using layers of abstraction As mentioned before a processor which is made up of thousands or more logic gates is kept comprehensible because the logic gates are not looked individually They are abstracted into components which are then abstracted into the controller or datapath Also other design tools and optimization tools are covered including finite state machines high level state machines Karnaugh maps and the Quine McCluskey algorithm Classroom instruction is done via lectures however instruction overall happens through three mediums lectures labs and Piazza Lectures are taught by the professor and are structured around the book which is presented with PowerPoints Each PowerPoint has a separate topic although it may take multiple lectures to get through one PowerPoint Lectures are also recorded and put on Blackboard along with the slides In addition to the main lecture there are multiple TAs available to answer questions in lab and on Piazza Both provide times for students to ask nagging questions and figure out how to complete lab assignments Lab assignments while connected to the course material are not explained in lecture Labs involve programming hardware using a hardware description language and this is not taught specifically making the TAs valuable resources for students There are two main types of assignment in ELE 206 along with one smaller assignment type Like many STL courses there is a lab component with demos and write ups and there are also problem sets Demos write ups and psets are all due weekly Labs cover material that is discussed in class although it is not all done with techniques that are explicitly discussed Labsaredone using Verilog a hardware description language and assignments are to program certain digital circuits using it however Verilog is not taught It must be learned from the TAs the Verilog guide provided on Blackboard or from other sources The circuits being programmed are from class however As far as handing in assignments demos can be done at any open lab section during the week as long as they are completed before Wednesday Demos are used to show TAs that your code works Also the write up can be submitted on Blackboard at any time although it is also due by Wednesday Not all labs are completed in one week so the demos and write ups may be for a check in for that week Problem sets are due on Mondays by the end of the day and cover material that goes along with the book and the lectures The third type of assignment is called a Key Ideas assignment It is a short 50 words or less answer to the big question from that days lecture and it is due before the next lecture starts External resources include Piazza and the course materials on Blackboard Piazza is a platform for answering questions with an online discussion board and is useful for having quick questions concepts and lab components explained The course materials are useful both for study and for information for assignments It includes lecture slides screencasts of lectures and the Verilog tutorial This course is a departmental for Electrical Engineers and is normally taken sophomore year It is also cross listed as a Computer Science class and is required for a concentration in systems for the COS major It requires a strong problem solving mindset and the ability to quickly abstract lower level ideas into high level ones or vice versa is incredibly useful for designing the systems you will be asked to design In fact many of the design problems can be very similar to puzzles making puzzle solving a useful skill as well Logical thinking is also needed especially when working with combinational logic and understanding what a low level circuit does Problems are rarely straightforward so an ability to creatively approach them is necessary While coming up with a solution can oftentimes be done algorithmically it is usually helpful to have an intuition for the problems This comes from the problem solving puzzle solving mindset mentioned before and can be developed by looking at and attempting to understand a variety of logic circuits Attendance in lecture and careful review for the Key Ideas assignment is also very important for understanding what each part of the circuits does which can make the intuitive leaps easier Studying is also best done in groups because multiple passes over the same circuit logic problem can bring up new insights that wouldnt have been possible alone Psets and labs can be done with a partner as well and it is strongly recommended to find a partner If nothing else having a partner is useful for tag team crunching out many long lines of Verilog and checking for silly mistakes that will make debugging a nightmare Overall take this if youre ELE or COS with a systems concentration or take it if youre interested in the low level architecture of a computer Bring your best puzzle solving and abstracting skills to the problem sets and prepare to learn how to use Verilog for lab sessions Overall the course leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment knowing that you now understand how the basics of a computer work and it teaches you engineering principles that apply very broadly outside of the field of digital logic ",

            "text": "This course combines historical and linguistic analysis in an attempt to understand how and why people are sometimes moved to try to transcend the languages to which we have natural or at least relatively easy access Among the examples we will consider are Esperanto Klingon Middle Egyptian Linear A and B Cornish Fortran and Proto World Taking a view that is broad both geographically and temporally we will explore in an interactive and collaborative way the philosophical and sociological implications of constructing and reconstructing languages for purposes that range from the political to the literary to the simply frivolous This course seeks to rattle shake and unhinge all preconceptions about language you might have If you enter the classroom on Day 1 thinking you have a vague sense of what language is you will walk out of it with more questions than you have answers The curriculum is built around various linguistic phenomena where the question of artificial and imagined languages surface the examples considered include Esperanto Klingon Middle Egyptian Linear A and B Cornish Proto World the language of the bees and extraterrestrial communication Through both synchronic and diachronic linguistic analyses this course offers a safe space for productive debates on the philosophical and sociological implications of the construction reconstruction and deconstruction of languages Class discussions and readings take on a tone that ranges from the political to the literary to the simply frivolous Engaging in discussion is highly encouraged The two professors take turns teaching the classes one lecturing and the other observing However the professors expect most of the talking to be done by the students not by the professors The professors usually teach with PowerPoint presentations However taking notes is essential because the slides are not uploaded to Blackboard Furthermore at the beginning of every class a student is asked to describe what was covered in the class before Since so much of class time is spent on debates it is essential to do the readings which supply the topics for discussion This is also the best way for the students to show that they came well prepared However since there is usually not enough time to discuss everything in depth during class going to office hours or emailing the professors with questions is also very much encouraged Assignments aim to give students a chance to showcase their creative flair and display their understanding of the material It is essential to do all readings prior to attempting the assignments Assignments are assigned weekly but students only have to complete 5 in total Example assignments include the decipherment of Linear B and Egyptian Hieroglyphs translation of poems from Esperanto into English and a diary entry using Basic English They all push students to think about the ways in which these imagined languages are artificial or not and highlight the challenges of using radically new forms of expression The creative project and final paper are two of the most important components of the course Students are given an incredible amount of freedom in both The creative team project could be related to any aspect of the class Last year projects have ranged from board games to the construction of a new language to documentaries Due to the variety of topics explored the professors want to give students as much agency as possible in their final projects so that they could choose something that truly interests them The final paper while more academic and less creative in nature is also not governed by any strict guidelines Students are allowed to choose any sub topic inspired by the class that interests them and are asked to write a 16 20 page research paper Many students take this opportunity to investigate aspects of their own language that they have not thought about before Engagement with the professors is essential while planning and working on the final project and paper Students are expected to have developed and discussed their ideas with the professors by the middle of the semester A week before the final class students submit their projects to a shared Dropbox folder The last class is devoted entirely to the discussion of the projects Seeing the fruits of everyones work which are all incredibly creative is the culmination of the class both for the students and the professors http www ipachart com Interactive IPA International Phonetic Alphabet Chart which will be useful for the first assignment Just click on the symbol and listen to the sound http www the10and3 com canada languages htm Linguistic map of Canada this is but one example of the many online resources that the

class in every sense every lecture focuses on a different aspect of the phenomenon of imagined and real what even is the difference you will explore languages from Klingon to modern Hebrew to linear B to the language of bees and aliens you will be island hopping from language to language continent to continent learning about the most fantastical elements of language Therefore in a way this is a survey course that does not spend an enormous amount of time on any one particular language This course is not for the student who is only interested in writing traditional academic papers assignments are often of a creative nature and will push against the boundaries of your imagination ",

            "text": "This course surveys the most important algorithms and data structures in use on computers today Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for sorting searching and string processing Fundamental algorithms in a number of other areas are covered as well including geometric algorithms graph algorithms and some numerical algorithms The course will concentrate on developing implementations understanding their performance characteristics and estimating their potential effectiveness in applications COS 226 is a survey course covering the most fundamental and important algorithms and data structures Because of this the material and assignments remain at approximately the same difficulty throughout The initial focus is on sorting algorithms then progresses to searching and ends with string processing The course includes additional discussion on regular expressions data compression and reduction Emphasis is placed both on understanding how the implementation of an algorithm or data structure works and on using them as tools in your code The programming assignments help you develop the problem solving skills needed to employ them beyond their most straightforward applications whereas the exercises and exams highlight the nitty gritty details of mechanics and performance Both are essential to succeed in the course and for a deep understanding of the concepts taught The primary challenge in this course is concretizing the algorithms from the abstract way theyre taught It can be difficult to look at the Javaimplementation of a given algorithm or structure and get a feel for how and why it works The demos and examples are crucial but its easy to memorize the steps needed to carry it out or a list of potential applications without truly grasping the algorithm Taking advantage of all the resources in the class will allow you to fully learn the algorithms and develop the problem solving skills needed to make you both a better student in thisclass and a better programmer overall Although the lectures are comprehensive it is important to engage with the material outside of class time in order to understand the concepts introduced Sometimes the implementations or derivations of performance characteristics are glossed over but reading through the lecture slides beforehand allows you to learn these denser aspectsat your own pace However the slides are modified slightly from semester to semester and they are not always updated soon enough before the actual lecture In such cases the old version of the slides is sufficient for previewing the material since the fundamental details of the algorithm or data structure will not have changed An alternate or supplementary strategy is to review the lecture slides afterwards to ensure you completely understand any math or sample code covered Another option is to read the textbook The course website provides the sections of the book corresponding to a given lecture but the lecture slides tend to be more helpful than the readings The material is condensed on the slides in such a way that the most important information is highlighted without losing any essential context Moreover the book and lectures are written by the same people so neither offers a new perspective on the other Thus the readings are generally only helpful when a specific point on the slides is unclear and you want to refer to a more thorough explanation During the lecture itself most students will find that it is not necessary to take notes Everything important is contained within the lecture slides and devoting time to writing down what the professor says can detract from your ability to follow along It can be helpful however to either have the lecture slides pulled up on your laptop or to have a printed copy accessible during class time This way you can annotate as needed and look back at previous slides if part of the lecture is too fast paced If you are participating in flipped lecture instead of traditional it is absolutely essential to watch the videos prior to coming to class The brief instruction in the beginning of class is meant to review concepts not introduce them for the first time and you will be unable to fully engage with the problems if you lack that knowledge To maximize the benefit you get from the flipped option its important to follow up with problems that you didnt understand or didnt have time to get to during class Salon is a great resource to view others solutions and to ask any questions you might have Note that flipped lecture requires extra time on your part compared to traditional lecture and it is geared towards people who learn much better through doing problems than listening or reading You will still have the opportunity for guided practice under the traditional option through precepts so you should only select flipped lecture if you are prepared to consistently devote the extra time Although precepts are optional for flipped lecture students it is useful for both flipped and traditional students to attend The most essential concepts are reviewed and the class goes through practice problems similar in style to the exam questions The main difference between the problem solving sessions in precept and flipped lecture is that much more structure is present in the former The class is given a set amount of time to work alone or together on each problem and then the preceptor goes over the solution While some problems are gone over as a class in flipped lecture the students are generally just left to work at their own pace and ask questions as needed Precept is also very useful for the help it provides on that weeks assignment Often practice problems will be presented that help you work up to the challenges you will face in the assignment and get you thinking in the right direction The preceptor mayalso go over the instructions themselves explaining them in a slightly different way from the online description and warn you against common pitfalls Overall precept is a great resource to reinforce what was learned in lecture and to prepare you for the upcoming assignment The programming assignments are the most time consuming aspect of the course and challenge you to use what youve learned in a meaningful application A common mistake students make is diving right in without taking the time to thoroughly read and understand the assignment Its easy to misunderstand the details of an algorithm or the steps youre supposed to take and end up sinking several hours into code that doesnt do exactly what its supposed to or reach the performance requirements Instead make sure you read not only the assignment page but the checklist as well particularly the frequently asked questions section Its also very important to start early every time Even if you think you know exactly how to do the assignment an unexpected bug or performance flaw can easily tack on anextra couple hours to the time you need to complete it If you run into difficulty Piazza is an excellent resource to consult You will often find that your question has already been asked or answered and if not you can add it to see if other students or the instructor can help you out For more immediate help office hours and lab TA sessions are offered regularly throughout the week so you can ask your questions or show your code in person Other than with the first assignment you always have the option to work with a partner The collaboration can be valuable because it allows you bounce ideas off each other in the event you get stuck but be careful who you choose to work with Its best to find someone who has around the same programming ability as you and works at a similar pace Otherwise one of you may become overly reliant on the other which is disadvantageous to both Even when you and your partner are evenly matched be sure that you completely understand all the insights and ideas your partner brings to the table Similarly you should take care to thoroughly explain anything that your partner doesnt understand While the programming assignments are excellent for applying a given algorithm or data structure do not rely on them to inform all your learning for the course Often the assignment will only address one or some of the key concepts introduced that week but its still just as important to be familiar with the others For this reason you should keep up with the lectures as described in the previous section reviewing or previewing as necessary in addition to attending class Furthermore the assignments only address application not mechanics or implementation The precept practice problems and Blackboard exercises will both help supplement this knowledge The exams are quite different from the assignments in that they do focus on mechanics and implementation with much less application The single best way to prepare is to do the practice exams provided on the course website and ensure you understand the solution of anything you get wrong Very similar types of questions tend to be asked from semester to semester so doing enough practice tests is sufficient to completely prepare you for all but the two challenge questions These questions are generally design based and while old exams will help you practice this type of insightful thinking you need problem solving skills and a strong understanding of the tools at your disposal to do well on this portion Study the lecture slides and demos to make sure you know how and why each algorithm works This course is largely self contained and the most useful resources are available within its framework However since the book and lectures are written by the same people sometimes you may wish to gain a different perspective or read an alternate explanation of a particular algorithm or data structure In such cases it can be useful to google the topic at hand The programming assignments are a step up in difficulty from COS 126 so this course may not be a good option if you struggled in its predecessor However this course teaches you all you need to know for most coding internships As such much of what you learn will also be useful for the technical portions of interviews If you are at all interested in software engineering this course is the foundation for coding for a wide variety of advanced applications ",

            "text": "The theory of functions of one complex variable covering power series expansions residues contour integration and conformal mapping Although the theory will be given adequate treatment the emphasis of this course is the use of complex analysis as a tool for solving problems The main goal of the course is to familiarize students with single variable complex functions and in particular how extending functions to the complex plane yields new ways to work with functions on the reals The course focuses on teaching students multiple strategies for solving certain mathematical problems that would otherwise have been very difficult or impossible A special emphasis is placed on creativity in problem solving and proofs Another point of emphasis is the application of complex analysis to other fields such as and especially physics The course can be roughly divided into two parts The first half of the course is almost completely focused on developing the central theorems of complex analysis It begins with the extension of real functions into the complex plane It then expands to complex generalizations of topics learned in other math courses such as Taylor series and the Fourier transform However initial familiarity with these topics while advantageous is not necessary as the definitions are self contained within the scope of the course The second half of the course involves application of complex analysis to problems in other areas of study In particular a relatively large amount of time is spent on developing techniques for calculating integrals on the real numbers in a simple manner No prior knowledge is assumed beyond the listed prerequisites Knowledge of linear algebra while officially a prerequisite is mostly irrelevant within the context of the course As with any mathematical course complex analysis is best learned through practice With this in mind the professor briefly defines the relevant concepts before working through examples usually distinct from the ones presented in the textbook The lecture proceeds in a very organic manner with a theme in mind but without any lecture notes Therefore taking adequate notes can prove to be very helpful when solving homework problems or studying for the exams Because the lectures are not based on the textbook the readings complement help to clarify any proofs or definitions not extensively covered in lecture The readings are fairly concise and often include fewer examples than desired This makes the examples in lecture serve as useful aids As the professor advocates creative problem solving he often also provides alternative proofs to theorems Comparing these to the methods shown in the textbook can be an effective learning tool Being able to think of alternative proofs independently can really only be learned through experience therefore while it is helpful to attempt multiple proofs there is no reason to expend too much effort on a single case Homework assignments are the primary way for students to become comfortable with the material This course introduces complex analysis mainly as a tool for solving problems Therefore through the homework students should focus on improving their problem solving abilities within the context of complex analysis The assignments consist of a combination of textbook and supplementary problems The supplementary problems are often directly relevant to examples or theorems covered in lecture For the textbook problems it is useful to read the relevant sections and examples as they will usually outline the best methods for solving those in the textbook An important part of problem solving is being able to identify classes of problems which require different strategies The exam problems are also similar to homework problems in that the goal of the homework and exams is to make sure that students know how to apply what they have learned None of the exam questions are inherently challenging but they require students to understand conceptual subtleties and to recognize which strategies and methods are needed for specific problems Homework assignments and exams from previous semesters serve as the best study aid as the exams do not have much variation across semesters The exams cover essentially the entire breadth of the material so there is no sense in which a student should study specifically for the exam instead it suffices that the student actually understand how to use the methods learned and how to derive the most important results Working out solved problems analogous to those on the problem sets is therefore the best method to study for exams This course is a good introduction for anyone who is interested in complex analysis for practical purposes as it discusses mathematical theory but does focus exclusively on it The tools learned in the class are helpful for building intuition for computing certain types of integrals in a simple manner They are especially applicable to physics Complex analysis showcases the elegance of mathematics and the course can be rewarding both for theory and for application ",

            "text": "Note Course number and name was previouslyMAT 215 Honors Analysis IAn introduction to the mathematical discipline of analysis to prepare for higher level course work in the department Topics include rigorous epsilon delta treatment of limits convergence and uniform convergence of sequences and series Continuity uniform continuity and differentiability of functions The Heine Borel Theorem The Riemann integral conditions for integrability of functions and term by term differentiation and integration of series of functions Taylors Theorem This course is intended to be a first or early experience in rigorous mathematical thinking In some sense the curriculum assumes minimal background as it attempts to construct some of the most fundamental tools in mathematical analysis The first couple of weeks cover basic set theory abstract algebra and the construction of the integers rationals and real numbers As the course moves into introductory point set topology it seeks to make students comfortable with thinking about and working with abstract mathematical objects specifically by constructing rigorous arguments Comfort with producing mathematical proof and thinking about mathematical concepts in a foundational manner is essential for further work in the math department or in understanding and appreciating the field of mathematics in general It is exactly this comfort that the department and instructor hope to build in MAT 215 and the later courses in the MAT 200 sequence As mentioned before the main vehicles for accomplishing this are linear algebra and topology These topics will introduce a host of definitions for mathematical concepts students have likely already been exposed to but have never had rigorously defined such as open and closed sets limit convergence continuity etc Some experience in introductory linear algebra is helpful in order to concentrate on the more abstract points of the proofs rather than the mechanics of matrix algebra Even so Professor Gunning assumes little to no background even in calculus Professor Gunning typically speaks quite quickly in lecture He writes fast as well Occasionally his words and his writing dont match up perfectly Although this style does call for significant concentration from the student there are certain advantages Professor Gunning has ample time to give a short review of material from the previous lecture in the first few minutes while also providing numerous examples of new concept he defines Starting lecture unsure of where the course left off can make the rest of the 80 minutes less valuable as they might appear to have little connection to previous topics Meanwhile examples of a new definition or theorem are often more illustrative than the statements themselves If a particular statement in class does not make sense at first finding specific examples opposed to general statements can be helpful Having a well rounded understanding of different statements is essential to being comfortable using them in ones own proofs Professor Gunnings pace in class allows him to include a large amount of content and examples but as a result there will be pieces that will not be picked up entirely in lecture While these items can sometimes be clarified by a question during class Professor Gunning provides his students will an excellent additional resource in his course notes which could more appropriately be called his book Nicely written and formatted and nearly 300 pages these notes form the basis of his lectures but they are also extremely helpful to look back on after lecture Also while many courses have certain expectations about learning some ideas in lecture others in precept and yet others from readings Professor Gunning removes such ambiguity from his class With the exception of a couple of examples omitted for the sake of time the content of lecture and the book is nearly identical even the notation All along one must remember though that the course is less about the content of Gunnings lectures and books and more about learning to engage with abstract mathematical objects and use them in the context of different mathematical argument Learning all of the finer points of topology is not the point while gaining the experience and comfort of using a set of previously proven mathematical results to prove a new one is The weekly assignments in MAT 215 are challenging but rewarding and overall are successful at gradually making students more comfortable with increasingly complex proofs Professor Gunning typically splits each assignment into Group I problems and Group II problems Group I mostly includes specific examples in analysis algebra or topology that one must verify satisfy certain definitions and theorems Group II problems are more complicated sometimes trickier examples but often involve proving corollaries of theorems proven in lecture and or in Gunnings book Since the style of these problems is much different than most students have seen in high school or even other lower division math courses at Princeton the assignments can take many hours to complete However these hours are undoubtedly the most valuable of the course If possible proofs do not come to mind immediately recall the definitions of the basic objects in question bijective mapping skew symmetric form compact space etc and try to connect these to the proofs of theorems proven in class Also when proving general statements such as something that is true for all compact spaces it often helps to try to understand first why it is true in particular examples for example why it might be true in a closed interval of the real line Exams are very brief relative to the problem sets With a time limit of three hours proofs must be kept rather short Thus problems typically require one or two clever applications of theorems from the semester but not much more The problem sets generally provide sufficient practice but finding some basic exercises in Rudin see External Resources section or online can provide good additional practice Remember the course is more about learning to do math in the form of abstract reasoning and proof writing while it is less about learning actual mathematical facts While all the problems terminology will come from course content the exams reflect this purpose Wikipedia can serve as an important mathematical resource While there might exist some questions of reliability or bias on many articles the pages on math are generally quite well done Reading definitions or theorems worded slightly differently or using different terminology can also make ones understanding of a particular statement more flexible and make clearer how to apply it in a greater variety of proofs There are also numerous mathematical texts on the subject of introductory analysis MAT 215 in previous years was often taught from Rudins Principles of Mathematical Analysis Some of the exercises in the book can be helpful for portions of the course but Gunning takes a much more topological approach to the content than does Rudin as well as including much more linear algebra so Rudin may not be as insightful for these portions of the semester Additionally the math department offers multiple problem sessions each week with older undergraduates who have been successful in the course These sessions are generally well attended and one can glean a lot simply from listening to the conversation of other classmates and how they reason through particular problems Learning alternative proofs or equivalent statements can lead to insights for other problems Sometimes a slight reframing of a definition makes clear its role in a proof This is why it is so important to read statements worded differently and understand a variety of examples Given the emphasis on mathematical proof MAT 215 is mostly intended for those looking to study math in detail in the future These students are most frequently freshmen and sophomores likely to concentrate in mathematics but the course can also be helpful to many students studying physics or economics Regardless of a students background or academic bent the course is among the most demanding prerequisite courses offered at the University requiring many hours of careful thought and concentrated study However at the same time many who take it find it to be a very rewarding and exciting experience giving them an introduction into what abstract mathematics looks and feels like ",

            "text": "See Princeton Writing Program website Like all of Princetons mandatory freshman Writing Seminars the ultimate goal of WRI 190 is to get students writing in the scholarly manner that will be expected of them for the rest of their academic career This is meant to be achieved gradually over the course of three papers of increasing length depth and breadth of material covered Additionally class discussion is geared towards getting students to approach the topic in a way conducive to their writing Peer reviews and discussions of papers in class provide more specific and detailed critiques Later these include conferences meant to foster an even smaller and more personal analysis This also serves the purpose of teaching students how to give helpful criticism while examining papers analytically The first unit of the course focuses on a book and a series of lectures and its goal is to approach the papers by focusing on how the two pieces interact The goal is primarily to create a basic arguable thesis to form the backbone of your argument and that of future papers The lectures are a bit dense and may require re reading after class discussion The second unit of the course pulls on a far wider selection of readings and a film Selections from four books are used to critically analyze the arguments made in a film This requires a different method than analyzing written works and focuses primarily on relating the readings to the film Therefore the emphasis is on citation and the proper way to bring in sources effectively The final unit of the course is a research paper on any topic in the broad category of American Mysticism This requires a lot of independent work which can include reading books blogs and articles watching videos or even conducting interviews During this time occasionally movies will be assigned to watch for discussion in class even if they arent strictly related to everyones topic The freedom for this unit is a double edged sword It provides a lot of opportunities for students to write intelligently about something theyre interested in and bring together diverse and interesting topics It can also be immensely intimidating since there is less structure and the topics are too diverse to permit a very codified approach to the topic Because this is a Writing Seminar the focus is on learning the underlying skills as opposed to the material That being said this course covers a lot of readings which range from historical to philosophical to anthropological Some are dense and hard to follow for one not innately interested in the subject Prior knowledge of the subject is not expected or required but could certainly be an advantage in choosing topics for the research paper Because each class is discussion based and requires participation attendance to every class is mandatory and only two absences are permitted for the entire semester Generally classes are a group analysis of the assigned material The instructor leads the discussion and steers it in the proper direction Sometimes the majority of the class is spent trying to find the key parts of the authors argument chiefly motive and thesis It is usually beneficial to take notes about these topics as they will be useful in the papers However they are often confusing or unclear Asking for clarification can be a great help in these cases Additionally it often helps to highlight specific parts of the texts analyzed either as things you want to talk about or have identified as important Throughout the course the instructor will provide resources on how to read and take notes effectively and go over them in class Experiment with a few different ones until you find one you like It is easy to become overwhelmed from the amount of material covered unless you follow some of the methods for a quicker reading described in the course It can be helpful to keep track of pages where topics you are interested in are covered so it will be easy to refer back to them while writing One aspect of classroom instruction that is particularly useful is peer review After drafts are submitted each person is required to read and write a review of two selected peoples papers In class there is time to go over each paper in detail and suggest particular strategies to improve it Sometimes the advice may conflict as people have different ideas of what they liked but always defer to the instructors advice A focus of the classroom instruction is on limiting the scope of ones claims This is something always addressed in regards to the readings and films and a constant topic of debate and correction in papers Taking examples from the readings and class discussion will help you to frame your argument in your papers which will save a lot of time and potential rewrites The conferences provided for each paper are also a valuable resource You meet with the instructor individually for the first paper with a partner for the second and in a group of three for the final paper Here you will get concrete and specific instruction as to the best place to go with your paper Be sure to spend some time preparing for these both so you have an idea of what you need help with in your own paper and what you think of the instructors comments but also so you are prepared to help the other students improve their own These conferences as well as class discussions go towards your citizenship grade This is easily augmented by participation in both areas and generally not a major concern for students It is a good idea to become familiar with all of the terms that commonly come up in class These will not only make it easier to contribute in class and write a better essay but it will also make it easier to follow whats going on in each class and help keep you up to date with the content It is incredibly likely that the methods demanded of students in WRI 190 are completely different than anything they experienced in high school Papers should be focused on analyzing how the author makes their arguments and the nuanced ways in which he or she is effective or falls short of his or her intended goal For students used to analyzing and debating the content of an article and not its writing style this can seem frustrating and even pointless initially The structure of the course accounts for this First drafts of papers are due After a few days the instructor will return these with comments before a conference and class discussion After going over the draft and suggested revisions there is generally about a week until the final paper is due The most important takeaway from a Writing Seminar is how to write and therefore the papers are by far the most important part of the course and where you will learn the most the subject of the class is secondary to this goal Frequently papers will need to be entirely rewritten from the first draft Sometimes it is easier to simply start from scratch with the new ideas and advice from the first draft in mind Dont be disheartened by this as everyone goes through this transition and once you adjust to the requisite style future papers will become much easier Take student suggestions with a grain of salt If they prompt you in a direction similar to the instructor or you find them interesting run with the idea but dont feel you need to account and correct for every one of them Do not expect extensions to be granted The course structure is quite rigid and rarely permits such changes Occasionally if the class is falling behind Prof Laufenberg will push everyones due date back a day or two but do not rely on this happening Start the papers as early as possible and be prepared to do lots of revision to your draft Far and away the best resource for a Writing Seminar is the Writing Center Here you can and should schedule appointments to meet with a fellow for an hour to go over your paper These sessions can greatly help you get an idea of where to go with your paper and some additional things you can work on Rarely do Writing Center fellows give you specific instructions Rather the goal is more to talk out the paper and try to figure out what you want to say with respect to the prompt with the fellow acting as a sounding board These appointments can help you figure out how to handle comments or work in new ideas Be sure to schedule these in advance It can also be a good idea to schedule multiple appointments in advance for a paper youre struggling with One early on in the process can help you get going in the right direction and one towards the end can help you make smaller tweaks to end up with the best possible draft or final paper Firestone Library and its resources including librarians are especially key in working on the final research paper Librarians can help you approach problems from new angles and find relevant and unique material you may not otherwise have considered Its large selection and online resources are also by far the easiest way to find scholarly material on your subject The goals of all Writing Seminars are very similar and their subject of research is mostly of secondary importance For that reason consider this class if you are interested in American mysticism and related topics However the focus will be on writing in a new way It will be a lot of work with a lot of time spent reading writing and critiquing There is a lot of material covered but plenty of resources available to get you through the class Once you get acclimated to this style of writing the class will become much more manageable The topics you learn here will be very relevant in any future courses you take that involve papers and will undoubtedly greatly improve your academic writing and thought process ",

            "text": "Classical Mechanics with emphasis on the Lagrangian method The underlying physics is Newtonian but with more sophisticated mathematics introduced as needed to understand more complex phenomena Topics include the formalism of Lagrangian mechanics central force motion and scattering rigid body motion and non inertial forces small and coupled oscillations and Hamiltonian chaos The course is intensive but rewarding The goal of this class is primarily to give you a different perspective on the Newtonian classical mechanics that you should be familiar with from school and or freshman year To this end the course reformulates mechanics in terms of objects called Lagrangians and Hamiltonians through the use of calculus of variations dont worry if youve never heard of any of this nobody has Professor Giombi then uses these as a jumping off point to reintroduce topics from previous physics courses such as central force motion oscillations and rigid bodies You will become intimately familiar with using these to solve problems and should be able to as Giombi puts it write down a Lagrangian in your sleep There are two primary ways learning operates in Death Mech One is information transfer which is almost exclusively done through Giombis lectures The other is concept reinforcement which is achieved through often long always challenging problem sets and to a lesser extent reading the textbooks Problem sets are meant to be done collaboratively Lectures in PHY 205 are fast paced and often conceptually and mathematically challenging However they are the primary method of information transfer in the course and its imperative that you take good notes You will be referring to them often during the problem sets Fortunately Giombi lectures very clearly and his accent isnt a lot to overcome After lecture you should have a conceptual understanding of the topic but dont worry if some details are missing or you arent sure how to apply itthats what the problem sets are for Be prepared to fall far behind if you miss even one lecture The course is such that every lecture builds upon the previous one particularly before the midterm It definitely helps to at least skim the relevant pages in the textbook before lecture and realistically many students painstakingly read every page when doing the problem sets anyway There are also problem solving sessions and office hours The former is useful to further reinforce the concepts but many students find this may not be worth their time to attend as this course takes up a lot of students time The latter is useful if you and your study group are completely stuck on a problem as Giombi will likely walk you through the problem The textbooks used in Fall 2014 were the comprehensive Thornton Marion and the smaller Landau Lifschitz Problem sets are from TM however the presentation of the content is often less than perfect LL will complement your understanding of the overarching concepts often explaining them in a clearer more concise way Problem sets are long and difficult Thats the intention so dont worry if you find them as such At the same time though do not underestimate them They are intended to take at least 10 hours per the registrar page and often will take closer to 15 20 overall Their main function is to reinforce the concepts learned in lecture by applying this knowledge to actual physical situations To this end the questions will often be harder than those youll encounter during exams Students stress the importance of finding a group to work with preferably with four or more people Youll be able to bounce ideas off one another and see how other people approach the problem This will improve your overall problem solving skills as well as help you to complete the assignments Youll likely have to comb through the books in order to find the relevant parts for the question so this too will help you to more thoroughly understand the courses material After you finish a problem set you should be able to complete it at least in principle on your own otherwise you will have a hard time when it comes to exams Exam questions are meant to be done individually so they will be substantially easier than homework problems There are two midterms and a final Make sure to THOROUGHLY read the lecture notes before exams On the midterm one of the three questions was about a topic that was discussed for about 20 minutes during one of the lectures Most people thought it was irrelevant so very few people correctly answered question Read Landau Lifschitz the smaller book before exams as it often presents content in a clearer more concise way than Thornton Marion Go through the problem sets and make sure you really understand the methods used to solve each type of problem This is especially useful since you probably did them in a group Along with the textbooks you will often make extensive use of the Internet throughout the problem sets Lecture notes from other universities will often explain things in different ways that will solidify your understanding of the material Dont be averse to using the Internet after all the point of the problem sets is to help you truly grasp the courses content You should take advantage of any resource you can find to achieve this end In my opinion however the most valuable of these resources is your fellow classmates Use them pick their brains help them youll end up helping yourself in the process almost every time This course is not intended to be tackled individually If you attempt to do this youre not taking advantage of everything at your disposal and are therefore putting yourself at a huge disadvantage relative to everyone else in the class as well as harming your own understanding of the content If youre taking PHY 205 often called Death Mech you fall into one of two categories Either youre almost certainly a physics major or youre doing the Engineering Physics certificate Youve probably heard horror stories about this class stories of impossible exams and 50 hour problem sets Fear not this isnt wholly true Most of these are at least a little exaggerated In fact even if you are a physics major you can still get away with taking Baby Death Mech PHY 207 You wont go as deeply into the material as you will in PHY 205 however Its a matter of personal choice how much you want to engage with the material Above all though Death Mech will teach you to think like a physicist and prepare you extremely well to solve problems you might encounter in the core classes Quantum Thermal or E M as well as those posed during independent work Ultimately the description intensive and rewarding given on the official course offerings page is accurate This is a test of the national broadcasting system It seems that there are two separate pages dedicated to this class where the main difference is merely that one of them misspells the professors name Would it not be sensible to merge the two

principles For a complete presentation of the subject the course should be followed by CHM 304B in the spring CHM 303 lays the groundwork for the year long sequence of organic chemistry orgo and is organized into three parts each of which builds on the previous one s The first unit introduces concepts needed to go forward The first section involves learning to name and draw compounds to become proficient in the language of orgo Then the basic properties and parameters of the named compounds and functional groups are introduced including electronic effects e g electronegativity differences size of different groups sterics and resonance Some of these concepts may relate to topics from CHM 201 2 or AP Chemistry but overall orgo is very different from those classes and does not require much prior knowledge from them The second unit covers methods of analyzing different spectral data A common problem considered during this unit involves determining a molecules structure given its spectra this occasionally uses concepts from the first unit These two units have a relatively manageable pace but the third unit picks up speed This is where the meat of organic chemistryreactions and all of their mechanismsbegins to be covered Most of the problems here ask you to predict the result or write a mechanism for a reaction you havent seen before considering reactions unit 3 but also basic parameters unit 1 and spectral data unit 2 Each unit culminates in a two hour exam luckily the lowest score of the three is dropped The final exam leans heavily towards the third units style as does the second semester Since the course is highly cumulative and concepts build on each other it is essential to know the early material While you are usually not directly asked to name a compound with its formal name being able to quickly put a structure to a name and draw can be very useful You use the basic parameters particularly resonance throughout both semesters as you try to judge what will happen in a reaction Having the basic concepts down also helps minimize being overwhelmed in the last third of CHM 303 Reading and reviewing the lecture notes is a good way to understand the basic ideas while extra problems are definitely the best way to practice and prepare for exams As the professors say the lecture notes are the primary source of material while the textbook is supplementary CHM 303 at Princeton tries to avoid unnecessary memorization All exams are open book and stress the ability to apply concepts to solve new problems Therefore instead of memorizing facts it is most useful to take complete and organized notes so you know where to find everything come exam day The best way to get better at exam problems is to do more exam problems which are easily found in the numerous old practice exams posted on Blackboard Not much background knowledge is assumed beyond the that from the prerequisite CHM 201 202 AP Chem As mentioned above though the material in orgo is very different from general chemistry Some people in the class probably had a little past experience with orgo but this does not make much of a difference If anything there was some implicit facility in laboratory skills that was expected Some students find adapting to the fast paced efficiency stressing environment of a Princeton lab challenging at first especially since if it is their first lab experience not working directly with a partner Lecture in CHM 303 is a little different than some other science classes Professor Semmelhack posts partially completed lecture notes online before class and completes them by writing additional phrases and molecules on them during lecture No need for notebooks or laptopsthe lecture notes are all you need to write on and sometimes the organic molecules are already drawn out for you Though a preceptor often posts completed notes on Blackboard after class it really is worth it to get up early twice a week for this 8 30 lecture Semmelhack explains the course concepts well and you will learn more from writing your own notes in addition to knowing where everything is for the open book exams A good nights sleep before lecture is extremely helpful especially come Thanksgiving and afterwards when concepts fly by more quickly in lecture For each unit the professor will also list relevant chapters and problems in the textbook These are completely optional If you do have time to look at the text much of the concepts are summarized nicely in the subsection headings Especially in Unit 3 and second semester pictures of reactions in the textbook can be helpful to look at The suggested textbook problems could be helpful but there are so many practice problems between precepts problem sets practice exams and optional review sessions that the text problems are not essential The textbook is also a useful tool in the open book examsbookmarking important tables or diagrams can help and if all else fails with a problem a quick check in the index is worth a shot at solving it Precept organization changed in Fall 2015 the year after I took the course Now there is a short period where the preceptor reviews concepts and the rest of the time is devoted to problem solving These precepts are very importantthey choose the most central applicable or difficult parts of lecture to review and then offer practice problems on those concepts If youre unsure about a concept take careful notes and dont be afraid to ask them to clarify something Its their job and they are very good at it Working in groups with the problems and asking questions may be helpful as the alternate perspectives of your classmates and preceptors can be invaluable A preceptors response may highlight a broader point or tip that can be applied to other problems Labs highlight some of the lecture concepts but are also designed to introduce basic organic lab methods and situations You cannot bring the official procedure into lab but instead are required to copy down the procedure steps into your lab notebook Make sure you know what you have to do as the lab is an efficiency based environment Students become quicker with experience but asking questions about proper technique ordering the sequence of procedures and anything you may be confused about can be particularly helpful Both the lab TA and Henry Gingrich the lab instructor are great at explaining how to perform lab tasks as well as how to connect lab work to lecture concepts Your fellow students are good resources too There are a couple graded quality control checks on lab products so be sure to know when these are so you can be extra careful those days Henry gives a few optional Lab Review Sessions that go over concepts covered in lab reports Very often the types of problems he does there directly relate to either the lab report or the corresponding exam at the end of every exam there is a lab related question Starring important takeaways and keeping these notes may be helpful when writing lab reports Problem sets are weekly and while not officially graded they may be most useful if done on time After precept they are the next introduction to the types of problems one can draw from each weeks lecture material It helps to have reviewed the lecture notes a bit beforehand and have them with you when you do the problems If you turn them in on time the preceptor will correct it which is a great help Note especially where you went wrong and consider keeping a list of tips tricks and patterns you gain from corrections There are a few lab reports each semester which take some time but are not overly involved Many of the most difficult questions are conceptual so asking questions in lab and going to Henrys Lab Review Sessions may be especially useful After unit 2 the lab reports begin to make heavy use of spectral analysis so it is essential to be comfortable with drawing conclusions from that kind of data Most of the grades come from the exams three 2 hour midterm exams at the end of each unit and a 3 hour final all open book The instructors allow each student to drop their lowest midterm score but note that most students find the third exam the hardest As mentioned above knowing where to find all your notes is extremely useful in tackling the open book exams One study strategy may involve reviewing the lecture notes and creating a mini table of contents of sorts to show in what lectures and on what page s to find each big picture concept a few nights before each exam Some students put similar study guide references together like a table summarizing all the unit 3 reactions or a sheet of tips and tricks on how to find a structure from spectral data Sometimes these resources come out of the McGraw review sessions see below Most importantly keeping past problem sets and exams as well as lab reports and procedures for the exams lab question may be very helpful One way to prepare for exams is to do practice exams which students may take under simulated test like conditions i e with study guides made beforehand keeping track of time etc Going over the practice exams afterward may be as helpful for mastering the topics as doing the practice exams themselves Answer keys with scoring are posted alongside past exams so it helps to correct your exams and perhaps even score them As with problem sets note especially where you went wrong and consider keeping a log of tips and clarifications Students should not feel like they have to take every practice exam they post but most students find taking at least two seriously to be most useful As the front page of the exam says WRITE SOMETHING partial credit can be very helpful in boosting the overall grade Even just writing part of a reaction or describing what general kind of structure the problem is looking for will help It is also beneficial to go over a midterm when it is handed back On a practical level you could find an opportunity for a re grade But like a problem set or practice exam a corrected exam is a great opportunity to see what you did wrong Investigating what the key did instead and adding those methods to your tips and tricks list may be especially helpful for future exams given the cumulative nature of the course There are so many resources for orgo The McGraw Review Sessions may be very helpful led by a grad student one night a week It is yet another opportunity to review class concepts and work through some problems with a teacher who will readily answer questions There are also the typical McGraw resources like Study Halls and Individual Tutoring which could be useful if you want to work in a group or get more peer help Self formed study groups can also be good for this class The course recommends you buy a modeling kit While it is never essential it can be very useful in unit 3 when orientation and spatial arrangements are covered If it is hard for you to visualize a molecule in 3D as it was sometimes for me they are a good tool to have While some of the horror stories are definitely over stated orgo definitely takes some work The weekly problem set load may not be heavy but when an exam comes up of which there are three plus the final there is a lot of preparation required Because of this its best to take orgo only if you have a compelling reason for it if you think you might be pre med or a CHM MOL CBE EEB etc major or know the concepts will be useful in your future path However dont be scared of it It is well taught there are so many resources and everyone is in the same boat Freshmen who place out of CHM 201 2 should feel welcome to take CHM 303 right away if their schedule allows According to Henry freshmen actually do better on average than sophomores and if you have to take it sometime anyway it will free up future years You will learn more about organic chemistrys application to biology and life sciences as well as some knowledge about chemical synthesis Youll also get so much better at problem solving and at the end of it all youll be proud of all youve learned ",

            "text": "ENG 206 is centered on this question how are different worlds crafted and constructed and what do they look like The goal of this course is to give students a foundational understanding of a wide range of fiction in order to provide them with the knowledge and analytical skills needed to read all forms of fiction In short this class has one goal to teach students to be strong readers More specifically although this course asks students to imagine alternative worlds found in fiction ENG 206 aims for students to be able to use various forms of literature including books images and films to understand the real world Thus students can approach this class with two objectives to read closely and to always ask questions that follow from these course goals The course is broken up into three units The first unit is called Realism and its Discontents In this unit students explore classic texts and are asked to question what makes a text a classic The first unit ends with the first paper due In the second unit students explore Allegory in texts In the third unit students explore genre and read texts that are representative of various genres and others that seem to fit multiple genres or reside outside of any genre The final paper is due after this unit on Deans Date There are two keys to being successful and learning in this class the first is reading all of the texts and the second is asking questions that a literary school would ask The class is made up of two 50 minute lectures and one precept a week In lecture the professors cover topics themes events and ideas that situate the books in the larger context of literary history The goal of lectures is to help students connect the texts to the real world The lectures are traditional in that students are expected to listen closely and take effective notes The professors also teach two of the precepts and so do not cover the same material they did in lecture Instead the focus of precepts is on deeper analysis and interpretation of the texts and students are expected to come prepared to discuss these texts in depth with relation to their plots and their forms This is why reading all of the texts and generating course specific questions is so important Students are expected to be able to engage with the text and with other students in precept The assignments are opportunities to engage more deeply with the texts They include two 5 6 page papers one due after the first unit and one due on Deans Date and one 10 15 minute presentation done during precept Prompts for each of the papers are typically given 10 days in advance which for some students is barely enough time to formulate an argument about a text and not nearly enough time to closely read and analyze a text successfully Thus it is important to stay on top of the reading and to also formulate questions and interpretations analyses as you go This helps you to read with purpose so by the time you begin a paper you have already been brainstorming and can focus your writing efforts in that 10 day span Active reading is also necessary for the weekly Blackboard posts students are required to do the night before each precept This is probably one of the most important assignments of ENG 206 Students are asked to write a short passage about sections of the text that stick out to them connections they made between that weeks texts and other texts or questions about that weeks reading or topics these are some of the questions you want to continually ask yourself while reading and thinking about the texts Students must also come to precept having at least skimmed their classmates Blackboard posts The weekly posts although sometimes slightly annoying are helpful tools for students They generate discussion in precept and they help students to become more comfortable with close reading and formulating arguments before the papers are due Think about what you can learn from reading others posts and read to do so For instance notice how fellow students make effective arguments use evidence and incorporate concepts and analytical tools introduced in class Finally the precept presentations are based on your own close reading of the text Students are asked to analyze one passage from a text present it to the class ask questions The student becomes the teacher Each week the precept generally starts off with discussion of the Blackboard posts and then moves to that weeks presentation So together the Blackboard posts and the presentations basically make up the foundation of precept One of the greatest resources of this class is precept Since precepts are so discussion based students have the power to shape them in any way that would be helpful for them Try to generate questions while reading and during lectureespecially ones that will help you explore a topic you might want to write about and ask a couple of them in precept Your classmates and preceptor will thank you especially when there is a lull in the discussion Additionally students are expected to read the texts both closely and in full which can sometimes feel impossible since reading closely takes time Students may consider using audiobooks from online or from campus libraries while reading to keep the pace up and get through the texts while driving working out etc Students probably should not take this course if they know for sure that they are not interested in the type of texts being read Many of the texts and films are science fiction and dystopian novels although not all of them are It is very difficult to stay engaged in class write successful papers and perform an effective presentation when you do not enjoy the texts If you do enjoy this type of literature or are open to reading works in and around this genre you will gain a lot from this class as the workload does not prevent you from enjoying the texts ",

            "text": "This is an intensive introduction to Ancient Greek It covers in one semester material usually done in the two semester introductory sequence CLG 101 102 Students who complete this course can take CLG105 in the Fall and CLG108 in the Spring This course aims at providing a reading knowledge of Classical Greek quickly Students are expected to be motivated and will have to set aside sufficient time for daily assignments CLG 103 covers two semesters of Ancient Greek grammar in one spring semester teaching the equivalent of CLG 101 and 102 Students start with no previous knowledge of Ancient Greek end the semester reading Classical texts like Platos Gorgias and excerpts from Greek thinkers like Aristotle and Isocrates in the original language The class aims to give students the solid foundation in Greek grammatical paradigms that is required to succeed in further courses in Ancient Greek literature It also urges critical analysis of the literature covered The class sequentially covers material from the textbook Greek An Intensive Course by Hansen and Quinn It begins with explanations in English of essential grammatical terms followed by declensions of nouns and present tense stems of verbs and then more complex grammatical constructions and syntax like conditionals and indirect statements and questions There is homework every night of the week weekend 1 hour night which includes translation and exercises that drill students in paradigms and vocabulary from the unit Since it is a fast paced course there is not much time for review of previous sections but as long as one keeps up with the course speed it is doable The class ranges in size In Spring 2015 there were three undergraduates and one postdoc student in the class but previous semesters have had ten or more students ranging in class year Our class had one Philosophy one Classics and one Politics major There is no singular defining background of the students who take this course except the motivation and desire to learn to read Ancient Greek and quickly Class time focused almost entirely on translation of assigned sentences and some sight reading from the textbook Not much time was spent discussing grammatical content from the textbook unless a student specifically requested this Professor Bourbouhakis alternated between students so each student had to be prepared to participate and translate each sentence or drill Before translating the text was read aloud As a result it was useful from the start to have the Greek alphabet and its phonetics memorized as soon as possible As the semester progressed class time was also used to discuss broader themes andquestions from Platonic texts for example what did Plato mean when Socrates ironically asserted that a teacher should be blamed for the faults of his student The course is fast paced Each week an average of two units in the textbook was discussed Students are expected to learn the grammar and vocabulary in the units on their own using whatever methods suit them To succeed in the course it is useful to learn the Greek alphabet before the class starts Things move fast and feeling comfortable reading words out loud from the start will be a big help Furthermore do not prepare word for word translations It may seem tempting to prepare word for word translations of the text before class but the goal of the class is to improve reading skills and simply reading prepared English translations will defeat this purpose Instead read and translate the sentences each night either in your head or on scrap paper Add minimal markings to the Ancient Greek text to help you work through confusing parts of a sentence Good notes to add unfamiliar vocabulary brackets around grammatical constructions marking up similar elements in a sentence like nouns adjectives and articles that go together As an example you can bracket off conditionals and purpose clauses in the Greek text add arrows from verbs to their objects and underline the subject of each sentence Create your own grammatical code to help parse nouns and verbs on the spot in class If you prepare well you will gain confidence reading Ancient Greek fluidly instead of relying on time with a textbook or dictionary to help you through sentences In addition it is helpful to follow along with the class When its someone elses turn to translate a sentence follow along Dont worry about mentally preparing the next sentence in case you are called on next Professor Bourbouhakis clarifies grammatical elements in class as we go over each sentence Theres nothing to lose if you forget something Every night there were 2 3 components to the homework 1 There were 12 drills which tested comprehension of the new vocabulary and paradigms from the unit Some drills asked to change the form of a verb or noun and to identify what kind of sentence or clause it was This is particularly useful for identifying these structures in authentic Greek texts where everything is more convoluted and difficult to translate 2 10 12 sentences are assigned for translation from the final section of each unit These were not authentic Greek sentences written by the likes of Aristotle but the themes presented in them were relevant to life and culture in Ancient Greece 3 Towards the end of the semester translation assignment included excerpts from authentic Ancient Greek texts in the textbook Classes alternated between translating an authentic text and pressing on with acquisition of Greek grammar When doing the homework assignments it is beneficial to drill yourself on new paradigms and vocabulary every night In this class it is essential to figure out what memorizing techniques work best for you Its fast so you need to quickly memorize the vocabulary and noun and verb endings before you finish a unit Methodically write out the paradigms of nouns and verbs and principal parts of new verbs every night Write them as many times as you need to whether its ten or fifty Maintain a dynamic list of new vocabulary as you progress through the semester and delete words youve learned well You need to absorb the vocabulary and endings until they are second nature If you dont invest the required time in memorization you wont be able to function at a higher level in this class Try finding a quiet corner in the library or in your room and say the Greek vocabulary and sentences aloud Ancient Greek was meant to be spoken and the best and most effective way to learn it is to speak it Secondly it is also beneficial to work together with your classmates This would motivate you to slowly and efficiently work through the text consolidation understanding of the information for each word instead of guessing based on context In addition flashcards could be useful For example one could put the first principal part of the verb on one side and write the other five on the other side The quizzes were mainly a way to ensure that students were keeping up with the pace of the course Generally there would be a sentence to translate sometimes taken from the homework assignment then there would be exercises to parse two or three words in the sentence and sometimes to indicate the grammatical syntax As long as you memorize the required endings and vocabulary each week quizzes are a breeze To prepare for quizzes it is helpful to meet outside of class and quiz each other on principal parts of verbs asking for example What is the second principal part of the verb The midterm consisted of the sight translation of 6 10 sentences we had not seen before The student was responsible for parsing selected words identifying case number and gender for nouns and person number tense voice and mood for verbs The student also had to identify the function of any given word in a grammatical clause and list the principal parts of selected verbs The final exam included six sentences which featured some of the syntactical types of sentences learned during the semester a previously seen excerpt from Platos Gorgias and a sight reading component from Apollonius For the sentences students were asked to parse two or three elements identifying case number and gender for nouns and person number tense voice and mood for verbs To succeed in the assessments Professor Bourbouhakis emphasized that if a student kept up with the material as the semester progressed exams would not require much extra studying or time This is very true Additional study strategies include condensing notes to make a packet of blocked notes from each chapter covered in the textbook For each section look at all the relevant resources the textbook your class notes etc Your packet should include all the noun and verb endings the book covers grammatical exceptions and the formation of every type of grammatical clause You will have a packet of important information available for instant review Secondly it is useful to maintain a list of verbs and principal parts Starting at the beginning of the semester it is helpful to have a packet solely for principal parts of verbs to read through as often as possible This helps to remember common endings and accents so that by exam period the principal parts will come naturally Perseus language tool perseus tufts edu An invaluable resource for checking accuracy in parsing verbs and nouns After you input a Greek word into the site it tells you its part of speech noun verb adjective etc and parses it for case gender number or person number tense mood voice  logeion uchicago edu a useful tool for checking definitions of words and challenging yourself to figure out the first person present form of a verb you find in a text Quizlet cards These were amazing ways to remember vocabulary for exams and daily use Look for Hansen and Quinn Greek vocabulary study cards Check out quizlet user PsapphoPslugs amazing card sets here https quizlet com PsapphoPslug and https quizlet com vidushisharma Ancient Greek language table This is a thrilling opportunity to interact with graduate students and to learn from them how to speak ancient Greek It is very useful for remembering naturally verb forms and common idioms which will show up often in texts  Optional Later in the summer at another Ancient Greek program the book The Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek was useful Its small and handy and presents a very quick overview of all the noun verb paradigms and most grammatical concepts covered in CLG 103 and essential for further Greek language study This is an intensive course On the first day Professor Bourbouhakis advised that in order to learn Ancient Greek well a time commitment was imperative A few times Professor Bourbouhakis mentioned that at Harvard the Intensive Greek course meets every day for two hours and counts for two credits but teaches the same amount of material Professor Bourbouhakis is a great mentor on campus It is rewarding beyond words to come into a class knowing nothing of a language and exiting after having read some of the most iconic works of its literature As an aside the entirety of the class 3 undergrads 1 postdoc came in already advanced in Latin This should not deter any potential CLG103 students as the class pacing is to some extent determined by the background of the students As Professor Bourbouhakis often reminded the class Winston Churchill once said Naturally I am biased in favour of boys learning English I would make them all learn English and then I would let the clever ones learn Latin as an honour and Greek as a treat ",

            "text": "Fundamental concepts of biomolecular structure and function will be discussed with an emphasis on principles of thermodynamics binding and catalysis A major portion of the course will focus on metabolism and its logic and regulation The aim of this course is to synthesize the material learned from introductory biology MOL 214 215 and organic chemistry CHM 303 304 304B while understanding the fundamental concepts of biomolecular structures and functions and metabolic pathways In short the course teaches students how food is broken in human bodies and then used for energy to power metabolism and to maintain homeostasis There are 2 midterm exams which essentially divide the course into thirds The first third emphasizes the principles of thermodynamics kinetics and catalysis and it may seem like a review of familiar topics from basic chemistry Biological macromolecules and their structures will also be introduced like carbohydrates lipids proteins and membranes and the student is expected to memorize the structures of key molecules like all the amino acids glucose etc A major portion of this course focuses on metabolism its logic and its regulation This material provides fundamental knowledge of the building blocks of metabolic pathways which will be explored in the second and third parts of the course The second third of the course is largely dedicated to learning the details of the pathways of cellular respiration glycolysis citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation There is a large focus on glycolysis and students are expected to learn all eight steps of the pathway including structures enzymes and mechanisms However as will become evident as the course progresses many pathways learned in one direction often have a reverse pathway and the course is structured in a way that once glycolysis is learned gluconeogenesis follows glycogen synthesis is followed by breakdown so on and so forth This method of how the material is presented throughout the course is carried into the last third of the course where more metabolic processes are covered fatty acid catabolism and lipid biosynthesis amino acid catabolism etc This fast paced course demands a lot of work both inside and outside the classroom more so than other Princeton courses First all materials and resources provided by the course range from required to supplementary none are optional if you want to do well in the course Second there are lectures three times a week plus precepts This course is also very time intensive A large amount of time will be spent studying lecture notes and reading the textbook on a regular basis in order to understand the material in manageable increments Since biochemistry is a very expansive subject there is an overwhelming amount of information to learn and this course really does need to meet as often as it does even spilling over into Reading Period Meeting during Reading Period serves two important functions 1 Kick start the brain after a long winter break 2 Comprehensive but not detailed review of metabolism and integration of metabolism which is the intellectual highlight of the course for most students as the details of the disparate pathways that have been learned will elegantly come together in human bodies Since this course is more biology oriented more memorization will be required than organic chemistry to do well in the course like enzyme mechanisms and reaction pathways However there is also an emphasis on problem solving through problem sets precept problems and exam questions of biochemical novelty and medical relevance The daily iClickr questions are also intended to not only help students keep up with the material but to also consolidate material apply knowledge and practice problem solving skills used to solve exam questions Lectures are structured in the sequence of the textbook and ensure that students are equipped with the fundamental knowledge of each topic After going through the material students will be expected to teach themselves and fill in the knowledge gaps Students will need to turn to the textbook to read the finer details of such topics which will be tested on exams Precepts also serve to reinforce the information learned from lectures and the textbook Students will be constantly synthesizing material from lecture notes textbook readings problem sets precept problems iClickr questions etc finding connections between different concepts This is the foundation for the conclusion of the course metabolic integration As the course progresses notes about how various metabolic pathways are integrated will be addressed When students gain a deep understanding of integration mastering the material will come less from memorization and more from biochemical logic Overall the knowledge and concepts extracted from textbook readings lectures iClickr questions precepts and problem sets all serve to reinforce each other The textbook Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry is like a guiding force in the course because lectures are carefully organized in the same sequence as how the material is presented in the textbook The readings will build on top of one another and this is evident by the cumulative nature of the lectures and the course in general Thus reading the textbook is very very important There is approximately 60 pages of reading per week from the textbook Compared to humanities classes this may not seem like much but the textbook is very richly detailed so the amount of time spent reading for the course may take up more time than expected The professor highly suggests students do the relevant textbook reading before class and to use class to reinforce the reading Reading the textbook prior to class primes the students brain for that days topic in lecture and also helps the student follow along with the fast paced lectures with less confusion The professor primarily uses the chalkboard when giving lectures Most student will find that taking notes by paper and pencil is more conducive and efficient for transcribing diagrams and structures Lectures also contain an interactive component of iClickr questions iClickr questions are unknowingly important By interspersing these questions throughout lecture these questions really help consolidate the course material and as the semester progresses these questions will also refer to concepts from earlier in the course These questions emphasize the interconnectedness of the course and help strengthen the integration skills students need to do well on exams and to understand biochemistry by orienting students to focus on connections within biochemistry to find the overlap between topics covered in lectures and the textbook and to continuously combine parts from various metabolic pathways into what will eventually become a giant web of processes happening in the human body Every lecture after the first lecture begins with iClickr questions which make up 10 of the final grade so it is important that the student arrives on time In the beginning of lecture there are two multiple choice questions based on previous lecture material These are closed book closed notes and no student collaboration is allowed This encourages students to review lecture notes before class and to stay on top of the material During the lecture there will be 2 3 iClickr questions where the student will be able to consult notes and sometimes converse with other students for difficult classroom polarizing questions iClickr questions are typically presented in multiple choice format in a similar style as multiple choice questions on exams The wording can be tricky in multiple choice questions on exams in that a single word in either the question or answer choice can significantly change the meaning of it so the student has to approach these questions with great scrutiny This pattern is mimicked well in iClickr questions too giving a good idea of exam expectations It is especially important then to double check answers and reading both the question and answer choices very carefully for multiple choice questions in this class Precept attendance is mandatory and will reinforce concepts as introduced in lectures the textbook and problem sets They are a practical experience in working with the material and solving additional problems in addition to problem sets and especially difficult problem set problems may be discussed further during precepts By communicating knowledge and problem solving methods among a small group students can learn from others content as well as helpful and novel ways of approaching such problems There are weekly problem sets which serve to reinforce fundamental concepts from the lecture and textbook readings Compared to learning through absorption in lecture problem sets are a learning activity in their own right in that students may learn through solving and applying Since the style of the problems is similar to exam questions doing the problem sets is good preparation for acquainting the student with the way exam problems are phrased as well as the nature of applying and synthesizing knowledge in order to solve a familiar easy medium level or unfamiliar medium hard level problems Because problem sets are not graded for correctness rather for completion it is in the students best interest to complete the problem sets as if they were being graded for correctness like providing answers in complete sentences drawing detailed diagrams and using lecture notes and or the textbook When problem sets are returned the student should make sure to understand the answers to each of the problems after the answer key is posted to Blackboard The student should understand why each answer received full credit the breakdown of points for each answer the fundamental concept each problem was addressing and perhaps think of other examples of how a future question on an exam may ask you to apply this concept again I think one of the biggest strategies for studying for biochemistry exams is prioritization Biochemistry exams cover an extensive amount of material and cramming a few days before an exam does not work well in this course Students have a variety of materials they can use to prepare for exams and going through all the lecture notes textbook readings problem sets suggested problems from the textbook precept problems iClickr questions etc is really too much and as Princeton students we honestly would not even have enough time to go back and sufficiently review all of these materials Therefore we must prioritize those resources to make the most of our precious studying time I found that the key study materials I used were lecture notes and the textbook The professor also gives a study guide with topics that could be tested on the exam I would suggest that as the student goes through lecture notes when studying to check off the topics being hit on the study guide and to go back to topics that were not addressed at all or in minimal detail and read them up more in the textbook For example the professor may only draw part of an enzyme mechanism in lecture for the sake of time to illustrate the final steps where an enzyme is converting a substrate to product but the student will have to return to the textbook to see understand and memorize the rest of the steps of the mechanism It is also very helpful to make diagrams and draw out enzyme mechanisms and metabolic reactions and pathways Biochemistry very much attests to visual style of learning and lectures often present illustrated views of concepts From my point of view I think students are constantly studying for biochemistry they are reading the textbook every week in preparation for lectures doing weekly problem sets and studying lecture notes prior to or during lecture to answer iClickr questions When it comes down to 1 2 weeks prior to an exam this is when the hardcore studying kicks in and students have to buckle down and dedicate extra time to reviewing the material in larger scope and ingraining minute details into memory These hours you put into studying will eventually pay off The point Im trying to drive home is to start studying early so that you can take on the density and propensity of the material one step at a time Keep up with the course throughout the semester by doing textbook readings and reviewing lecture notes right from the beginning and it is very important to begin memorizing amino acids enzymes molecular structures the professor specifically tells the class the memorize early on because it will make the subject material more manageable for the student and the brain to process Repetition facilitates memorization so I suggest the student should re read lecture notes and or the textbook to cement the content There are optional night time 1 hour review sessions which are another resource to reinforce course material and reviewing key concepts They start off with a quick 1 or 2 slide content summary for the week If the student has been attending lecture keeping up with textbook readings and is on top of the material then this summary should sound like a brief overview Use this summary to do a mental check that you understand the big picture and broad themes in the content that week This is followed with original examples different from lectures and precepts which are framed in the style of exam questions and also focus on applying fundamental concepts Because exam questions require students to apply fundamental concepts to familiar and more complex problems this section of the review session is helpful for preparing your brain to approach and answer these kinds of questions which are not only novel examples but also because they follow the exam format These review sessions are also opportunities for open Q A to help prepare students for precepts and exams and I suggest listening to your peers questions to see if you can mentally answer the question yourself as well as to jot down notes as the TA is answering this question Since this class is required for MOL concentrators and premedical students it is largely composed of students from these fields However compared to other MOL departmental courses it provides more resources to help you learn the material and to master this class Lectures are also structured in a more student friendly manner Compared to other premedical classes it is more contextually applicable to medicine and to understanding human body functions and metabolism which is a rewarding aspect of the course for most students Having a basic understanding of organic chemistry CHM 303 304 304B is very helpful as much of biochemistry lends itself to organic chemistry concepts and lectures often make references to reviewing certain sections of the Sorrell organic chemistry textbook Having an understanding of introductory chemistry CHM 201 202 may also be helpful near the beginning of the course where the emphasis is on thermodynamics kinetics pH and equilibrium The material learned from MOL 214 215 is not as prominent as the aforementioned courses but having a good grasp of general biology is the last piece of the puzzle to the orgo chem bio trilogy that underlies the expansive biochemistry narrative For students who are considering taking this class out of interest or to fulfill an STN distribution requirement I want to reiterate that this course demands a lot of hard work due to lecture time independent studying textbook reading and all other time you can spend perusing the many resources available However you will definitely learn a lot and deepen your understanding of how human bodies work while meeting one of the most passionate and engaging lecturers on campus If you are in this situation and are leaning towards enrolling in biochemistry I would highly suggest a 4 course semester for the main reason that you will be dedicating a lot of time inside and outside the classroom for this course ",

            "text": "Companion course to MAT201 Matrices linear transformations linear independence and dimension bases and coordinates determinants orthogonal projection least squares eigenvectors and their applications to quadratic forms and dynamical systems MAT 202 provides an introduction to Linear Algebra for students with little or background in the subject Most of the students who take this class are engineers because it is a prerequisite For the most part the topics covered in MAT 202 and MAT 204 overlap However MAT 202 is more geometric and tangible while MAT 204 is more theoretical and proof heavy Most students take this course in the Spring having taken MAT 201 in the fall However there is minimal overlap between the two courses and they can be taken in any order The course begins with an introduction to matrices and their utility in solving systems of linear equations followed by linear transformations in n dimensional space using different coordinates systems and bases These topics are meant to provide students with a good foundation for the rest of the course The course then focuses on the application aspects of linear algebra Topics covered include orthogonality and least squares fit used to plot a line of best fit given a set of points determinants used to calculate areas volumes of shapes undergoing transformations eigenvalues and eigenvectors quadratic forms singular values linear dynamical systems all used to solve systems of linear equations and even differential equations For someone who is entirely unfamiliar with the course material the first few weeks might seem too abstract The course attempts a geometric approach whenever possible so that students can tangibly see graphs and solutions to problems We can all visualise 2 and 3 dimensional space but what about 5 and 6 dimensions And how can every axis in these dimensions also be mutually perpendicular It is concepts such as these that make the course challenging One has to accept that some problems cannot be visualized and must be verified solely on the basis of algebraic laws The course progresses at a rapid pace building on the previous weeks of material For this reason it is extremely important to know the first few weeks of material exceedingly well since that provides you with a strong conceptual framework By the end of the course students should be comfortable using matrices to solve an array of different problems involving linear equations in n dimensional spaces The class is taught in a series of small classroom lectures at most around 30 students each taught by a different professor Perhaps the most important thing to do is to find a professor with whom you both enjoy learning from and teaches in a style that you find helpful Definitely take the time at the beginning of the year to sit in on a couple of different professors lectures There are a lot of different professors teaching this course you will understand some of them better than others As mentioned above the class can move quickly and builds off of material introduced at the very beginning of the year Most often the class follows a structure of introducing a theoretical topic providing a proof of why some mathematical formula holds and then examples of how this topic and formula are put into practice After viewing some examples and seeing how the formulas are put into practice the proof often makes more sense One effective note taking strategy is to write down everything said in class even if it does not make perfect sense at the time Draw as many diagrams as possible too because it always helps to be able to visualise a problem when possible Later revisit these notes and see if they make more sense In the case where things do not make sense the professors are open to questions and will do their best to explain If you do not understand something in class make sure you ask about it as soon as you can If you have a question chances are someone else has that question too so it can actually be helpful to ask the question out loud If you really do not want to ask the question out loud then email the Professor or go to his her office hours There is also a problem session held with one of the Professors or TAs every week These session are not mandatory but attendance is strongly recommended because they discuss difficult true false questions Quizzes and exams always have a true false section which is generally the most difficult section to do well in In addition these sessions provide an opportunity for students to ask any other questions they might have One could think of these sessions as a mix of lecture and office hours Assignments in MAT 202 consist of a problem set due every week intended to reinforce the material introduced during lecture The problem set questions are from the textbook and mimic many of the examples given in both class and on quizzes and exams Collaboration is allowed and highly beneficial Assessments for the class come in the form of two quizzes a midterm and a final exam The questions for these assessments are very similar to the examples done in class and those found on the problem sets Additionally the class provides previous years assessments that contain problems very similar to those on the actual assignments Working through the previous years assessments and reviewing notes from class on the topics specified for the assessment is a good way to prepare There is a true false section that is unlike the homework problems and can be less directly related to the material introduced in class than the other questions posed However using both the examples given from past assessments as well as the weekly true false problem sessions it is possible to get an idea of what the section will be like It is worth noting that some of these exams have equation sheets attached to them as the emphasis is on learning why and how to use the equations rather than pure memorization of them It is worth clarifying with your professor whether an assessment will have a sheet like this in order to optimize your study schedule The primary resources for MAT 202 are the lectures the textbook It is highly beneficial to read the chapters being covered in class before lecture and the examples in the textbook can be very helpful if you ever find yourself stuck during a problem set Students also have access to lecture notes and a collection of true false problems with solutions that are discussed each week at the problem session These resources should be highly utilized by students since these notes are compiled by the same people who set the exams As good as the textbook and your professor might be it is always a good idea to get different perspectives and to learn the same topic using different approachesespecially for the more challenging abstract topics Some resources you can use are McGraw Study Hall Khan Academy and even youtube This practice helps to clarify and concretise the concepts being learnt Additionally the mathematical software language Matlab is designed to manipulate and use matrices to perform mathematical computations It is worth taking an hour of your time to watch youtube videos or even just go to the Matlab site and read through some of the introductory articles in order to familiarize yourself with the basics of Matlab The software itself can be downloaded for free through Princeton Not only is this an invaluable programming language to get familiar with especially if you plan to go into any sort of engineering but it also can be used to help solve many of the problems that you will see in MAT 202 This course is more abstract than MAT 103 MAT 104 and MAT 201 which might make it a little more challenging It is heavier on conceptual knowledge the true false section is intended primarily to test concepts than preceding math courses The numerical calculations involved are not the focus rather the challenge lies in being able to think a little out of the box and really understanding what is occurring conceptually Knowledge of the subject material has vast applications to solving systems of linear equations that one might encounter in the real world and more specifically in the field of engineering It is no surprise that this class is a requirement for all BSE students ",

applications double and triple integrals vector fields and Stokess theorem The stated objectives of this course are to give a thorough introduction to multivariable calculus and mathematical methods needed to understand real world questions involving quantities changing over time in three dimensional space Because this course emphasizes concrete computations over more theoretical considerations which is more appropriate for MAT 203 there is a much greater emphasis on actually solving math problems rather than proving them however even though the topics covered are useful for solving real world questions almost none of the problems are in an applied context The pace of this course is extremely fast and many students who do not have prior knowledge of multivariable calculus find it to be very intense The course description indicates that a prior knowledge of calculus MAT 103 and MAT 104 is required however there are several hidden expectations This course is comprised of many sophomore students who are continuing the math sequence from previous semesters so professors do not treat this as an introductory course For many freshmen students who are taking this as their first math class at Princeton jumping right into a comprehensive class that is not catered toward freshmen can be very difficult It is important to note that the structure of this class is somewhat atypical from most classes taught at Princeton Instead of a having a large lecture accompanied by smaller precepts there are multiple sections of MAT201 classes that are taught by different professors In order to standardize the material taught professors will often teach the same questions based off of very similar problems seen in the textbook This is the only component of the course so if you do not understand the material being taught you need to either switch to a different professor in another section or else attend office hours or the McGraw Center In order to get the most out of the class it is recommended to read the material in the textbook before the lecture so that you are familiar with the terminology and basic concepts prior to coming to class The material covered in this course is strictly from the textbook The purpose of problem sets in this course is to ensure that you are keeping up with the material covered in class They are in no way indicative of the level of rigor of quizzes and exams and primarily serve to boost your grade and get familiar with applying new concepts The quizzes and exams are very challenging and require the ability to approach complex and unfamiliar questions using the techniques learned in class The most useful thing one can do to prepare for these assessments is to do as many previous exams as possible once you do several of them it is very easy to see what types of questions they ask and what topics they feel are the most important Because this class is so fast paced and there is only one class component to this course many students use external resources to learn and review the material The McGraw Center has both individual tutoring options and group problem solving study halls that are tailored towards MAT 201 Almost all students work together on problem sets and will go to office hours to seek help Additionally there is an amazing series of lectures taught by a visiting Princeton professor Adrian Banner available on YouTube These lectures cover essentially the same material covered in the actual class and is extraordinarily well taught with excellent example problems The link for all of his lectures can be found here www youtube com playlist list PLGqzsq0erqU7h6_bpE CgJp4iX5aRju28A very significant percentage of students enrolled in MAT 201 have actually already taken a course in multivariable calculus in high school and are taking this class for the second time to fulfill distribution requirements This means that because you are graded on a strict curve relative to your peers there is a significant disadvantage from the very start for students who do not have experience with multivariable calculus Due to the nature of the class being split into multiple sections there are inherent differences in the styles of teaching in each class It is strongly recommended that you shop around between different MAT 201 sections to find the professor that suits you the best Keep in mind that although this course in extremely rigorous and is graded on a curve the distribution of grades is often so low that the curves will actually help most students Getting a 40 50 on an exam is not necessarily cause for alarm if the passing grade is a 20 Lastly even though people should not focus solely on the grade earned because this is a very large quantitative course it is very easy for professors to only take into account your performance on assessments when determining your grade It is completely common to get an exam back fraught with grading mistakes because the graders did not take enough time to actually understand the students work i e if the answer is wrong you will likely receive very little or no partial credit Always review your exams with your professor and take the time to walk him or her through your work so that you get the grade that you actually earned ",

            "text": "Continuation of MAT103 Topics include techniques of integration arclength area volume convergence of series and improper integrals LHopitals rule power series and Taylors theorem introduction to differential equations and complex numbers MAT 104 is designed not only to familiarize students with the mathematical processes of Calculus II but also more significantly to develop students problem solving abilities by asking them to apply the covered mathematical principles in often complex and unfamiliar problems on problem sets quizzes and exams The course covers integration infinite series and an introduction to differential equations The organization of content within these units is highly cumulative and builds in complexity Though the complexity does develop throughout a unit because the pace of the course is rather quick it is helpful to attempt to anticipate and predict how the complexity might progress or be added to fundamental principles or concepts as they are introduced either by glancing at the readings for the rest of the unit or looking at some of the challenge problems before you will be expected to know how to solve them Students are expected to have background knowledge of concepts covered in Calculus I MAT 103 or equivalent These concepts and skills include limits continuity integration definite integrals the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and some basic integration techniques Because MAT 103 and 104 use the same textbook it is easy to review these concepts at any point in the course if necessary Another less obvious expectation or demand of the course is the ability to do mental math efficiently as calculators are not permitted on quizzes or exams Calculators may be used on problem sets but whenever possible it is beneficial to attempt calculations mentally in order to practice this skill for quizzes and exams It is also expected that students will show their work on all problem sets quizzes and exams Lecture The purpose of the lecture is according to the syllabus to provid e an intuition for the main results usually via examples instead of focusing on proofs This description is very accurate though exactly what this looks like may depend on the particular instructors style It is true across sections that proofs are not a focus of the course However some instructors may approach providing an intuition for main results in different ways Some instructors prefer to do fewer examples for the benefit of really understanding the problem solving technique Others prefer a breadth of examples and therefore go through many different examples in class at a fast pace As a student it is important to respond to and supplement these different styles Generally because lecture is focused on examples in both cases it is helpful to clarify concepts by doing the assigned reading before lecture Also if the instructor does fewer examples in more depth a student might supplement lectures with more practice problems from the book or practice exams see external resources below after or outside of lecture Conversely if the instructor goes through many examples at a faster pace it is helpful to go through lecture notes following lecture with a focus on understanding the general techniques rather than the specifics of the problem itself In regard to lecture notes it is often helpful to write down every step that the instructor writes on the board so that they are understandable and analyzable when you return to them Assigned readings Instructors recommend completing the assigned readings from the textbook before coming to lecture and doing so is definitely useful as explained above However it is important to be strategic about how this is done Because the lectures are heavily focused on examples it is beneficial to focus reading of the text mainly on concepts and general applications in the texts examples before lecture Although reading the text before lecture is important it can be sometimes confusing or overwhelming if the student is completely unfamiliar with the content as many are In that case the concepts often become much clearer through person to person explanation in lecture Therefore it is often helpful to read the text for general familiarity with the concepts before lecture but then also to return to it and the examples more in depth following lecture when the concepts are likely to have been clarified Because the quizzes and exams present unfamiliar problems it is often most useful to read and study the books examples more for an understanding of general problem solving techniques than for the specifics of the particular problems Office Hours Students are able to attend any instructors office hours so it may be beneficial to try out a few of the instructors office hours at the beginning of the semester so they can get an idea of which instructors style best fits their learning style It is best to at least attempt the problem set before attending office hours so students have particular questions in mind Another source of particular questions could be difficult problems from the previous problem sets quizzes or exams Office hours are also a great time to get more in depth explanations of difficult concepts Problem sets The main function of problem sets in the course is to develop the students ability to apply mathematical principles to complex and unfamiliar problems Students are expected to take away primarily the ability to independently apply concepts to new and difficult problems Though collaboration on problem sets is allowed it is often helpful to attempt the entire problem set if only just the beginning of each problem independently because it allows one to build up problem solving skills and confidence for quizzes and exams Some of the lecture examples will closely resemble the problem set problems if not in format then at least in technique They are often higher in difficulty level though Similarly the difficulty level of the exam questions is often higher than that of the pset problems An effective way to prepare for and tackle a pset is to maintain a focus on general problem solving techniques throughout lecture and readings as they will be most useful when it comes to attempting a problem set A great way to learn from the problem set is to do an overview of the problem set in its entirety if not directly after completing it then at least before exams to get a mental index of techniques used that can be readily and easily referenced for quizzes exams and future problem sets Tests Quiz questions require applications to more complex and unfamiliar problems In many cases exam questions require synthesis of concepts in addition to application to complex and unfamiliar problems This synthesis most often manifests in the multiple steps of the problem In order to begin the problem a student may need to apply one principle but then to complete it he or she may need to apply another one When studying for quizzes and exams it is beneficial to review lecture notes and assigned readings primarily for an understanding of the different problem solving techniques that unify different example problems It is helpful to create an actual index of these techniques that you can review and reference leading up to the exam and then immediately before it for confidence and self assurance as you head into the test itself One of the most helpful ways to utilize the practice exams and other practice problems see external resources below posted by instructors is to attempt them on your own and to try to get as far along in the problem as you can If you get stuck or are unable to do a problem it is alright to reference the exam key to see how to complete it However because exams often have relatively few questions with multiple parts it is beneficial to return to the same exam or problem the next day or the next week to attempt to do it again and see how far you get The hope is that you will eventually get to a point where you are able to do all the steps without referencing the key One great external resource is the Ed Nelson site accessible by typing MAT 104 Ed Nelson into google if the link is not working Ed Nelson was an instructor for MAT 104 at Princeton years ago and therefore his website contains older exams that instructors may not post to Blackboard The most effective way to use this resource is to do practice problems As described above it is best to attempt them on your own and to try to get as far along in the problem as you can If you get stuck or are unable to do a problem it is alright to reference the exam key to see how to complete it However because exams often have relatively few questions with multiple parts it is beneficial to return to the same exam or problem the next day or the next week to attempt to do it again and see how far you get this time The hope is that you will eventually get to a point where you are able to do all the steps without referencing the key Students can expect to develop highly valuable problem solving skills as well as to learn central concepts of Calculus II The problem solving skills developed are invaluable in any course or independent work undertaken at Princeton Additionally knowledge of Calculus II will be used in many upper level or even introductory level science courses like PHY 103 and PHY 104 The time demand of the course is mostly what the student makes of it beyond the commitment of the weekly problem set Students who are eligible for placement into MAT 104 see the departments website for information on placement should not be deterred from taking it in favor of a lower level math course because of the difficulty level since the difficulty of courses in the math department stem primarily from the need to apply concepts to complex and unfamiliar problems which is relatively constant across the course levels ",

spectral theorem singular value decomposition Jordan forms other topics as time permits More abstract than MAT202 but more concrete than MAT217 Recommended for prospective physics majors and others with a strong interest in applied mathematics Prerequisite MAT104 or MAT215 or equivalent The MAT 203 204 sequence is an intermediate step between MAT 201 202 the engineers multivariable calculus and linear algebra and MAT 215 17 or MAT 216 218 for math majors The two courses emphasize proof based mathematics and explore more abstract ideas while also providing concrete applications MAT 204 generally follows Penneys Linear Algebra Ideas and Applications 3rd edition in chronological order and covers roughly the same material as MAT 202 but approaches the material from a more theoretical and proof based perspective For instance the course begins introducing the abstract notion of vector spaces as they apply to not only vectors but also matrices polynomials and functions The course repeatedly emphasizes the broader applications of linear algebra to these abstract objects to prepare for applications to Markov processes the Fourier transform graph theory differential equations and quantum mechanics MAT 204 begins with vector spaces Gaussian elimination and various relationships between row space column space null space dimension and linear independence it then focuses more on matrices and their properties then more specific vector spaces where structures such as the inner product are defined in the last few weeks the course begins to apply the concepts covered to statistical methods such as principal component analysis and various applications named above In parallel students are taught MATLAB briefly in precept and through optional problems in problem sets in preparation for two MATLAB assignments Prior knowledge of linear algebra is not required for this course but the professors move so quickly through the basics of vectors and matrices that it is useful to have prior exposure and experience with these ideas Students are expected to come to lecture having read relevant textbook readings problem sets take substantial amounts of time and should not be left to the night before and exams expect proofs of mathematical statements rather than computation For a student not accustomed to proof based mathematics and even for those who are well versed with proofs the course will be challenging and considerably time consuming Nevertheless the course is very rewarding and students leave the class with very solid foundations for applications of linear algebra in fields beyond vectors and matrices e g quantum mechanics and the Fourier theorem Lectures are designed to supplement textbook readings by covering selected proofs in detail and explaining the motivations behind particular steps as well as introduce the material Beside certain topics such as applications that are not covered in the textbook and must be learned in class lectures can be seen as a way of interactively asking for clarification on particular steps in a proof the approach to a proof or the place of an idea in the broader context of theory and pure mathematics Although lectures are not mandatory it is highly recommended to attend because it will take substantially more time to catch up a missed lecture than to attend it Precepts are generally used to cover example problems from past exams but the preceptor will also answer particular questions about the material and introduce some of the material for upcoming lectures Students should come to precepts having a working knowledge of the lecture material in order to get the most out of this part of the course There are three forms of graded assessment in this course weekly problem sets two quizzes a midterm and a final and two MATLAB assignments In Spring 2015 problem sets accounted for 18 each MATLAB project 1 5 each quiz 12 the midterm 20 and the final 35 Problem sets consist of a selection of textbook problems and supplementary problems that highlight the various applications of linear algebra e g image processing data compression Lagrange interpolation spin matrices Problem sets also usually contain optional MATLAB problems These are designed to teach students who have little or no prior experience with MATLAB but even students experienced with MATLAB should attempt or at least read through them because they address aspects that are specific to linear algebra and will help students prepare for the two MATLAB assignments Each problem set will take a non trivial amount of time particularly because many problems expect the student to think of and write logical proofs something that cannot be done quickly under time pressure It is recommended that students collaborate in study groups to approach problem sets but attempting each problem individually before collaborating will help prepare students for exams for several reasons firstly problem sets serve to solidify and consolidate the abstract concepts learned in class it is important to be able to compute for instance eigenvectors as well as prove relationships between these concepts secondly there are tools and techniques introduced in both textbook and supplementary problems that will be very useful in quizzes and exams Problem sets are generally based on material covered in class during the week and serve as good consistent preparation for exams To get the most out of a problem set students should make note of original ideas or clever tools that proved valuable in approaching a problem Throughout the week students could also compile and maintain a list or mind map of concepts and links between them e g the dimension of the row space the dimension of the column space rank for a high level mental map of how various concepts relate to each other Students should however be careful not to cut corners with proofs of theorems in the textbook or in lecture The initial reaction may be to discard proofs in favor of the main idea of the theorem itself but as proofs of similar theorems or lemmas are a substantial portion of quizzes and exams students should consider stepping through proofs carefully and writing them out themselves in their own time In general students should aim to gain an intuitive understanding of how concepts relate to each other and also why fundamentally they relate in that way Quizzes and exams have a mixture of calculation based questions e g diagonalize the following matrix and proof based questions e g Show that any n x n complex matrix A satisfying A3 A is diagonalizable usually involving one question with several true false sub questions prove if true find a counterexample if false Thus there is a mixture of direct application and computation and synthesis and application to unfamiliar problems To prepare for these assessments students should first ensure they conceptually understand processes that will be used in the computational part of the quiz exam and be able to quickly and reliably apply them to compute the desired answer Second students should also aim to be comfortable with manipulating relationships between concepts for the proof part of the quiz exam by doing practice problems in addition to the problem set if this can be managed and practice exams a number of past exams are usually uploaded a few weeks before each quiz exam Many students in the past have benefited from maintaining a list of important mathematical definitions theorems and properties along with lay explanations or analogies of what a definition or theorem is saying in essence and brief outlines of two or three steps that are critical to the proof of each theorem This serves both as revision after class to consolidate understanding and as pre exam study material exams are closed book closed notes no calculators For the T F questions students should aim to become familiar enough with the material that they can quickly decide whether or not a statement may be true They should also be careful not to spend too much time explaining a proof for these questions because they may be pressed for time for the remainder of the exam MATLAB assignments are worth a very small portion of the overall grade although each assignment is essentially as important as one problem set both about 1 5 of the overall grade and are not assessed in any quizzes or finals However MATLAB is a very useful and important tool in numerous fields from pure and applied mathematics to physics biology and engineering Thus although the assignments are together worth only 3 time should be taken to understand how MATLAB works and how to use it in linear algebraic and other applications As with any other course at Princeton office hours are an incredibly valuable resource A few McGraw study halls arealsoavailable for MAT 204 although support is limited Itmay be helpful to reach out to friends who have previously taken MAT 204 or friends studying to be math majors to ask specific questions There are also great online resources e g Khan Academy although it focuses more on application than proof lecture notes from other universities equivalent courses the Nipissing University linear algebra help site http algebra nipissingu ca tutorials vectors html that may help clarify anything students are not certain about For checking computation on problem sets and practice exams MATLAB is a very useful resource although care should be taken to not become too reliant on it since it is not available during quizzes or exams MAT 204 teaches linear algebra with both practical and theoretical outlooks Students leave the course with a far deeper understanding of the nature of linear algebra and its applications in signal analysis and theoretical physics than students who take MAT 202 but also with the practical linear algebra background for physics and engineering Thus MAT 204 is particularly good for physics and engineering track students who appreciate and want to learn more about the theoretical foundations of what they are learning While not as mathematically rigorous as MAT 215 218 this course together with MAT 203 prepares students well for higher level math courses such as analysis algebra and topology It also serves as a good foundation for the mathematics of quantum mechanics and signal analysis Students who were concurrently studying this e g through ISC 233 234 ELE 201 or PHY 207 found that this provided them with a deep appreciation for the linear algebraic foundations of this material Nonetheless MAT 204 is a particularly time consuming class much more so than MAT 202 The weekly problem sets if combined with a lot of other coursework can become relentless and can lead to weekly all nighters It is important to remember however that staying up all night to work on 1 5 of the overall grade is not as valuable as sleeping and studying more effectively for an exam or quiz worth 12 or 20 Many students begin linear algebra in MAT 204 and drop to MAT 202 without much difficulty because similar material is covered in the first few weeks of the two courses In general most engineers take MAT 202 some engineers and physicists take MAT 204 which is nominally recommended for physics and math majors although only a few math majors take MAT 204 and most math majors take MAT 217 A lot of additional information about MAT 204 and similar linear algebra courses can be found here http www math princeton edu undergraduate course mat204",

program development It is a course required for COS major and certificate students and knowledge learned in this course lays the groundwork for more advanced computer science classes in the department The class covers a broad set of topics from general development advice e g how to test and debug a program to specific details of programming e g how memory is allocated in a symbol table and intends to equip students with knowledge and tools that will be beneficial in a wide variety of fields in computer science such as programming languages algorithms compilers software development and others In regards to the topics covered the course is divided into three major parts machine organization and assembly language programming program design and development and software tools COS 217 Fall 2014 General Information More specifically speaking the course will teach students programming in the C and Assembly languages which are low level programming languages low level refers to languages closer to computer architecture instructions which are generally more difficult to learn general program construction development and refinement memory allocation and implementation in data structures and process management In addition the course introduces students to terminal programming and useful programming tools such as Gprof GDB and MemInfo Prerequisites This is one of the three introductory COS course with a class prerequisite of COS 126 General Computer Science or equivalent in programming experience The Java programming experience gained in COS 126 was useful as a high level object oriented programming language The professor may mention core concepts or structures taught in COS 126 Most of the material taught is new for a majority of the class and builds on top of knowledge from previous weeks as opposed to building on top of knowledge from COS 126 or COS 226 Out of the three COS introductory courses COS 126 COS 226 Algorithms and Data Structures and COS 217 students may wonder which class COS 226 or COS 217 is more appropriate to take after COS 126 While students may find taking COS 226 easier since it like COS 126 is taught with Java the topics of COS 226 and COS 217 are essentially independent Certain algorithms from COS 226 may be referenced in COS 217 but these references are nonspecific and used in demonstration COS 217 focuses on certain data structures that are are studied in COS 226 but a sufficient introduction to these data structures is given in class Note about technologies used It is recommended to program in emacs a text editor that can be launched within the terminal It can be daunting to start terminal programming However the first precept will review setting up your computer environment appropriately If there are additional problems asking a preceptor in office hours or on Piazza can be helpful If you would like to program in another text editor like vim or Sublime Text be aware that the professor provides an emacs config file that allows you to format your coding file correctly within emacs and these configurations will not be copied over to another text editor It is helpful to develop a cheat sheet of relevant terminal commands over the semester especially those for tools such as Valgrind and Meminfo The course has lectures and precepts both of which meet twice a week Outside of these there are office hours and lab TA hours offered As with many COS classes there is a Piazza discussion Q A forum As such there is a wide variety of help offered throughout the semester In the semester I took this class the professor Robert Dondero requested that students not use laptops in lecture A helpful alternative to laptop notes was printing out the slides before class and writing notes next to the relevant slide In general the professor closely followed the slides but also interjected with useful information for example noting where a particular topic might be helpful for a later programming assignment Printing out the slides beforehand made it easy to follow along and write notes when the professor added comments Broadly speaking lectures cover the new material of the class at a higher level like different types of memory management or ways to debug your program while precepts go over the core concepts and are more directly applicable to programming assignments Both are important to learning the material and performing well on programming assignments so attending all lectures and precept is highly recommended Precept handouts are especially helpful as references for programming assignments and exams since they specify the core how tos how to reference a pointer how a heap manager is implemented etc The required reading is helpful as a reference although a very close reading is probably unnecessary unless a student does not follow the lecture The most important information is covered in lecture One exception is the required Bryant OHallaron reading related to the Unix Shell programming assignment there is a fair amount of useful information for the assignment in that reading If a student is new to C Programming or studying for the exam keeping the King C Programming book close is recommended The course recommended reading is relevant and interesting but not critical to success in the class Program development is a task that requires both a sense of the overall structure of the program and attention to the minute details Even a simple one off error can result in a common COS 217 bug called a seg fault which can cause hours of searching Precision and order is emphasized in assignments so sloppy code may cost as many points as nonfunctional code As for assignments start early It is not uncommon for COS 217 programming assignments to take hours longer to complete than anticipated Starting early will not only give you time to go to office hours but you will also miss the crowd of students at office hours the day before the deadline One way to approach assignments is to first gather all relevant materials for that assignment the assignment itself all related precept handouts and all related lecture notes Then review and understand the core concept behind the programming assignment e g registers or Assembly with the Assembly assignment Precept handouts often directly relate to assignments If anything is unclear Piazza is a helpful resource for general questions related to the assignment If you get stuck during an assignment it may take hours to identify the problem and fix the bug One crucial tool for debugging is GDB the GNU Debugger which allows you to step line by line through your code Memory errors like seg faults do not show the particular line at which it crashed so stepping through your program line by line is one of the fastest and easiest ways to locate the bug GDB is a tool automatically accessible in the terminal if your environment is set up according to the first precepts instructions If you have been stuck for hours it is highly recommended to go to office hours and ask the preceptor or professor for help since they usually know the solution to the assignment and have experience with the common errors that students encounter Lab TAs can similarly be useful in these cases In these assignments getting another pair of eyes to look at your code can save hours of time Before submitting your assignment be sure it passes the style check tests splint and critTer As stated before you may lose points for sloppy coding Commenting code is essential to writing good code so you also may lose points if your code is not commented adequately As for exam preparation past exams and solutions are made available beforehand It can be difficult to predict what types of questions will appear on the exam so taking practice exams will let you work through many different types of questions Take as many as you can and review all of the solutions Review the slides and precept handouts as well since they will cover core concepts that are sure to be on the exam for example process management If a solution is unclear asking on Piazza is helpful and answers often appear within the same day During the exam be sure to pay attention to details You may be required to trace through code in which case a one off error will cause a wrong answer Be careful of getting stuck on a problem in the middle of the exam easier problems should be tackled first before the harder problems which can take longer than anticipated All of the knowledge necessary to the course is included in either lectures precepts or readings and the information is often conveyed clearly If one concept is particularly difficult to understand it may be useful to search online for tutorials or videos explaining it COS 217 is a substantial programming class Assignments can take many many hours to complete depending on how quickly you resolve bugs In low level programming errors are particularly difficult to find so it is easy to let an assignment eat hours of your time Despite this the concepts taught in COS 217 are fundamental to the study of computer science and useful even for the student who does not want to focus on programming systems Personally taking this class confirmed to me that I really wanted to be a computer science major Even though the class is difficult the assignments are awesome for example after programming in the shell for a semester you actually get to code a Unix shell in C COS 217 gives you insight into how computers work at a very low level which is useful in software development Furthermore it equips you with tools necessary to become a better programmer in general Its a difficult class but the gains are worth the effort ",

            "text": "Economics is the study of how people and societies deal with scarcity This course focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of market systems for allocating scarce resources Introduction to Microeconomics ECO 100 gives students a broad overview of microeconomics and is geared towards those who have never been exposed to the topic before or those who are looking for a more in depth introduction than an economics class taught in high school After a brief introduction to the entire field of economics the course dives into three main themes 1 Consumer Theory 2 Producer Theory and 3 Government Intervention More specifically topics include how economists think the basics of supply and demand how firms and consumers make decisions and what can affect equilibrium with a focus on taxation and welfare analysis Miscellaneous topics that are also briefly mentioned include healthcare Professor Reinhardts specialty and financial valuation It is worth noting is that Professor Reinhardt supports a more technical version of the course in which intuitive principles are taught first but then backed up with their mathematical interpretations This is done in the following three mathematically rigorous steps 1 Comparative Statics how does equilibrium change 2 Incidence Analysis who bears the brunt of the new policy 3 Economics Welfare Analysis how do consumer and producer surpluses change This framework is crucial to the class and highlights the relationship between cause and effect Typically a number of the students enrolled have taken an economics course before in high school However absolutely no previous knowledge is assumed or expected and the course covers all the necessary information and topics needed to succeed ECO 100 has two 50 minute lectures and one 50 min precept per week Due to the pace as well as the large size of the lectures there is no timefor questions during the class In addition lectures are generally reserved for introducing new concepts and intuitive ideas rather than working out specific problems examples In contrast precepts are meant for applying the materiallearned in lecture and are largely driven by questions Additionally new concepts are often introduced duringprecept as well so weekly attendance and participation in class is essential The class lists the official textbook asPrinciples of MicroeconomicsbyMankiw However as Reinhardt also mentions the lecture notes and discussions in class are much more advanced and mathematically involved than those written in the textbook Thus it is important to to attend lecture as reading the textbook is not sufficient An extremely useful strategy is to print out the lecture notes before class so that notes can be taken directly on them This saves time from having to re draw graphs write down important concepts and instead lets you focus on Reinhardts verbal comments If you do miss a class borrowing a friends notes and attending office hours to review what you missed is a great solution One thing to keep in mind is that the final exam makes up the majority of the grade distribution 70 in Fall 2014 and thus largely determines the final grade in the course The rest comes from the midterm exam 20 and problem sets 10 However although the weekly problem sets are only worth a combined 10 they are arguably the most important part of the course The problem sets are the only opportunities to apply the knowledge learned in lecture and thus essential for success on the exams As each weeks topics build on each other it is recommended that you completely understand the solutions to the previous weeks problems before attempting the new set In addition while it may sometimes seem easy to simply plug the given numbers into an equation that was derived in class its extremely important to have an intuitive understanding of the solution as well Reinhardt likes to present problems in different forms on exams and having that intuitive understanding will allow students to identify the relationships between problems and recognize which formulas are the relevant ones As for the exams both the midterm and final include a combination of multiple choice and short answer problems While the problems on exams tend to be a bit harder than the ones from problem sets they are relatively straightforward There are many great resources for introductory microeconomics topics on the web One in particular is the Principles of Microeconomics course by MIT Open Courseware http ocw mit edu courses economics 14 01sc principles of microeconomics fall 2011 index htm This free online resource includes video lectures homework problems and solutions and practice exams As the topics parallel those in ECO 100 students may find it helpful to watch the videos as a supplementary to complement lectures or use the homework and exams as practice problems Also going to McGraw Study Hall Independent Tutoring is highly recommended as many students have gone through ECO 100 in the past and have great insights and tips on how to do well in the course ",

            "text": "The course focuses on basic principles governing the equilibrium behavior of macroscopic systems and their applications to materials and processes of interest in modern chemical engineering In the first half of the course we introduce the fundamental concepts energy conservation First Law temperature and entropy Second Law thermodynamic potentials equilibrium and stability and the molecular basis of thermodynamics These ideas are then applied to problems such as calculating the equilibrium composition of coexisting phases and reacting mixtures or analyzing the thermodynamic efficiency of cooling and power generation cycles There are two mid term quizzes which naturally breaks the class into two sections The first focused on the First and Second Laws of thermodynamics and the second focused on mixtures of materials and relationships between energy forms The most challenging aspect of the class was that it was highly theoretical so required patience to understand each derivation I thoroughly read and reread the textbook and used the preceptors as a valuable resource The problem sets are very time consuming so office hours are an incredible resource to work with your classmates and ask questions Following all the examples in the textbook and completing all the practice problems and old exams posted on Blackboard really help you see how the equations are used before exams Aksay focuses on derivations and theory in lecture He explains the roots of the all the fundamental equations which you will need to use on problems sets and exams It really helps to read the textbook chapters as thoroughly as possible before coming to class He presents the textbook in lecture form so it might be useful to have textbook open and write in comments or material that Aksay adds in class It is difficult to follow lecture if you have had no previous exposure to the material It is essential to stop Aksay when you cannot follow because if you do not speak up he will fly through the material Aksay is a fun professor so occasionally he will perform a demonstration Before exams he brought us croissants and gave us a problem relating to the thermodynamics of croissants The textbook is an extremely valuable resource Read before lecture reread after lecture and understand all the examples Take notes in the textbook and write down your questions to ask in class and in precept Every sentence of the textbook shows up in problems sets and exams Aksay does not provide many examples in class so it is crucial to go to precept and go through all the examples in the textbook to see how the equations are used In precept each of the three preceptors took a turn presenting an example problem It is a night precept so naturally people are sleepy but do your best to learn from each example they give There are problem sets due every week These problem sets are very time consuming but valuable in the learning process They include both derivations and applied problems Often the homework problems parallel an example in the textbook Each problem teaches you a concept or equation you will need to know for the exams Take your time on the homework and make sure you understand every part of each problem and every assumption you make Do the problem sets during office hours because they are challenging and nearly impossible to complete on your own Occasionally the problem sets require knowledge of Excel and Solver which the preceptors can help you with The assessments are very fair but extremely long There are two in class midterm quizzes and a final exam They consist of some conceptual multiple choice and true false questions with explanations as well as some applied free answer questions It is useful to study by going through all the homework solutions completing all practice problems on Blackboard completing and understanding all old exams and rereading the textbook The exams are designed so that no one will finish Do not dwell on any one question Write down the relevant equations look for keywords in the problems eliminate variables that are negligible and show what you know If you look at a problem and have no idea after thinking for a while move on and demonstrate your knowledge on another problem The graders will give lots of partial credit for simply writing down relevant equations There are office hours with the preceptors offered three nights per week from 7pm 10pm as well as a one hour office hour with Aksay Office hours were an incredible resource so much learning went on each time The night office hours are the best way to finish your problem sets It is best to take a look at the problem set before arriving The whole class attends and it is best to work on the problem set with your classmates and ask the preceptors questions when you are confused or unsure The preceptors are very dedicated and will take the time to explain everything Office hours were my favorite part of the course If you need additional help preceptors will also meet with you individually Meeting one on one can be a valuable resource before exams Thermodynamics is incredibly time consuming and it is not a very intuitive subject While it is challenging it is also really interesting There are incredible resources available for this course mainly the office hours This class also strongly encourages students to bond with their CBE classmates which is really nice While thermodynamics is a challenging class it is incredibly rewarding when you master the material and it is incredibly useful ",

            "text": "Content is grouped thematically For example star birth star structure star development and star death are all taught in sequential lectures The entire course starts locally and ends with the universe However there is a lot of distinct material to keep track of With this structure students are exposed to the basics of every topic If any particular topic seems fascinating there is enough depth behind to leave students feeling they learned something substantial  COURSE GOALS CURRICULUM The textbook provided a lot of depth especially mathematical The lectures present similar material but in less depth and with more applications The topics covered in readings and lectures donot completely overlap some lecture material is absent from or only minimally found in the textbook and vice versa The more that you can remember intuitively from classroom instruction as opposed to by rote memorization the easier it will be to retain knowledge The textbook is designed to give you the most thorough and rigorous understanding of the material but its also really big and full of way more details than is generally necessary Lectures are meant to reinforce the textbook material and expand on certain aspects not covered in the textbook Lecture slides are posted online after lecture because there is often too much information to properly absorb This is especially true of mathematical derivations they are challenging to fully comprehend when presented in lecture If a derivation is important or interesting you can go back to slides after lecture and try to follow and understand it One approach would be to skim relevant chapters before lecture In lecture take note of concepts that are emphasized in both the book and the lecture as these tend to be important Taking notes to supplement the lecture slides prompts greater focus and understanding during lecture The lecture is most constructive viewed coherently and interconnectedly which is difficult to do when youre jotting everything down Lectures often include application exercises towards the end where an equation learned in that lecture is applied to an actual problem Taking these seriously and thinking about the concept behind them instead of simply just a plug and chug which they often are will make them more bearable and can even make them useful exercises to get you to understand the concept more intuitively This course can be done without reading the textbook and by only going to lecture However because any individual topic can often go by fast in lecture the textbook is extremely useful for reinforcing concepts and preparing for the exams Also many homework problems require equations that come from the textbook rather than lecture The goal of the psets is to get you to understand the concepts through application which is most effective when you are already familiar with the theory of the concept from reading or lecture Frequently the psets will draw from concepts or equations not directly covered in lecture so they are conducive to expanding your field of knowledge Some questions are very foundational and asks you to apply an equation others however require you to connect multiple equations and concepts When stuck on a question a useful approach is to find a relevant equation that includes the final answer and to work backwards from the answer Sometimes the textbook that introduces that equation will provide hints on interconnected equations so referencing back to the book is extremely useful Sometimes there are very non obvious or elusive ways that problems need to be tackled and as such the psets should be started 2 4 days before the due date so that you have time to talk with classmates go to office hours or go to the weekly problem sessions to get your questions answered Attempting the psets alone and then meeting up with a classmate to discuss tricky concepts or to check answers is a useful strategy to consolidate understanding of the concept and also to provide a support system if something stumps you The exams are tricky because they require a certain amount of memorization There are many concepts and equations introduced throughout the semester and you are expected to know some basic ones by memory on the test However the level of what basic equations are is not always clear A general guideline is that if an equation has many terms its probably not one that you can be expected to memorize if it only has 4 variables and it was used multiple times in either lecture book or homework its probably useful to know There is also a section of the exam that asks conceptual questions and so remembering a little about everything will allow you to be able to answer a greater breadth of questions Use lecture notes to obtain a big picture perspective These will help you remember more concepts and topics which is often more important than understanding any one in depth The practice test is useful to give you a feel for the structure and format of the test but be careful not to assume that the topics explicitly covered on the practice test are the same the challenge of the tests is that the potential material they can cover is so broad but the material they will actually cover for time constraints is limited In general external resources are unnecessary Keeping informed about astrophysics news can be interesting and provide a cool connection to class or get you to think about a concept you learned applied to real research but is not necessary This course seeks to give students with no previous background an exposure to a wide variety of basic astrophysical concepts Having some prior understanding and knowledge of the universe will help and being comfortable with algebraic manipulations and calculus are necessary to follow the math An understanding of Newtonian mechanics is assumed as is evidenced by the PHY 103 prerequisite ",

            "text": "This course aims to both present a survey of historical content and theories that center around drug policy and to help students develop the analytical methods needed to synthesize primary and secondary sources of different media The content is organized thematically with a loose chronological structure and each weeks theme is clearly presented in the syllabus Each week tackles a different historical instance of drug policy or trends in drug consumption looking at the relevant time periods through demographic economic political and cultural lenses Because it is a survey course lectures present a few general narratives connecting the various components with more depth provided by the readings and in precept Professor Wailoo uses lecture to engagingly highlight primary sources from the readings that demonstrate the attitudes towards the drug of interest and how the attitudes may have shifted over time reflected larger cultural trends or resulted from targeted associations with different racial groups broadly defined The lectures also present the evidence and analysis needed to answer the Question of the Day which is posted at the beginning and end of lecture At the end of lecture students are required to write a short response to the question and hand it in to their preceptor Professor Wailoo then chooses a few salient points to include at the beginning of the next lecture which keeps the lectures somewhat interactive Precept discussions are based on the readings but because the assigned readings can range from political cartoons to ethnographic studies it can be hard to know how to synthesize and apply the readings to the questions in precept To prepare for precept you also have to take good notes in lecture as the professor does a lot of the narrative stitching that will be asked about in precept but the slides arent very informative on their own As you finish the readings and take notes keep track or actually sort the types of evidence used Also use the Questions of the Day to keep the themes organized The written assignments precepts and readings all pose different challenges in this course A few short analytical essays will be required in the course and the challenge with these assignments is introducing depth to the themes of the course though the course itself is presented as a broad survey Because the lectures dont delve too deeply into any particular drug or primary source it can be hard to assess the level of specificity required in the essays The readings themselves are also a challenge because of the sheer quantity required in this course About 200 pages are required a week and the course draws a lot from the required books which are academic secondary sources and can be dense To address the first challenge the best move would be to pick a topic that is very specific and that you are really genuinely interested in The essays are open ended restricted only to a time frame but if you simply choose to answer one of the Questions of the Day in an essay you will be writing too much and you wont be doing the in depth analysis required for the assignment Also try not to get bogged down with too much research start writing sooner An early meeting with your preceptor can help focus both your topic and your research In order to actually finish the readings for precept turn to the syllabus The syllabus includes reading questions as well as the titles of the weeks lectures which can give you a sense of what the intended takeaway from the weeks readings will be In terms of remembering and understanding the content attending lecture is the best way to stay caught up each lecture is presented as a narrative and though it can jump chronologically at times the themes are always clearly presented by the end The most general takeaway of this course is a better understanding of the different factors that influence the policies that are passed and enforced in our society In addition to the research that goes into a piece of policy the course highlights the political economic and racial elements that can shape both legislative policies and social norms Content wise the course emphasizes that drug policy is shaped by the time and doesnt necessarily reflect a scientific comparison of the benefits and hazards of taking the drug Any media studies race relations or health policy related course would be a good follow up as the course integrates all of these subjects into an engaging historical survey It is also a very freshman accessible class with a manageable workload and no prior knowledge assumed ",

            "text": "This course aims to examine major global health topics which currently pose problems potential threats and policy challenges around the world Due to the three hour duration of each class session each topic is explored thoroughly in an in depth manner The topics of the class vary by year and are chosen based on their current relevance to global health and health policy That being said topics may include AIDS in America synthetic biology infectious etiology of cancer and the Cost of Cancer to name a few Each week there is one three hour class session which covers four aspects of one topic as presented by four students Each student presents for about twenty minutes with another twenty to twenty five minutes for questions from the class Each group of four students works closely with one of the professors to decide on unique and interesting aspects of their topic to present This allows for individual time with the professors in which students and professors might be able to get to know each other Throughout the semester three guest speakers present on their areas of expertise All are very engaging and informative Participation is a key part of this course and students are expected to draw from the reading so that they can contribute questions and comments during the presentations It is easy to listen to student presentations but it is more difficult to question the things that your classmates are saying and to point out things that they may have forgotten While these things may seem difficult or unpleasant they are critical to the participation portion of this course Once the student gets into this mindset and is able to practice the techniques it becomes easier to question both articles and presenters Practice makes perfect A third challenge of this course is determining the level to which taking notes and paying attention to detail is important Since there are no exams taking meticulous notes about every biological mechanism that is discussed is probably not the best idea Instead trying to really listen and engage in the class in order to grasp the big picture and the message of the presentation is more important While specific details are not necessarily important understanding is and being engaged in class will hopefully provide this The bulk of the reading material for each class consists of scientific articles and epidemiological studies The most challenging part of this course is learning to question both the readings and your classmates It is easy to passively read scientific articles and accept everything that they say as true To be successful in this course however students must be willing to think critically about potential flaws the studies may have and what implications these have for the interpretation of results A second learning challenge for this course is the choice of which topic to present While preferences are considered the overarching topic for the session is assigned to students and then they are able to choose within that topic what they will present on It can be difficult to narrow down the topic to something that is manageable to present in twenty minutes as well as interesting and unique By starting as early as possible after the theme assignment and doing a good deal of background reading it should become easier for the student to find an interesting and unique aspect to present on Choosing a topic that you are passionate about if possible is often the best route to take since this will allow you to engage students more and allow for a better presentation overall Engaged students will find it easier to do the necessary research for the presentation so that they are never caught unaware for a question Finally speaking with the professor mentor early and often is another key to success They can often help direct you on which topics will be interesting and engaging for the class The first suggestion I have for this course is to do the reading prior to seminar This course is always taught on Thursday nights so students have all week to do the reading and it is not an overwhelming amount so it is definitely doable This will allow the student to start thinking about the topic and developing questions about the papers The second major component of the grade is the presentation which makes some students more anxious than others I would recommend starting the presentation as early as possible so that going over it with the professor is an option Incorporating any feedback is a good idea since the professor is the ultimate judge of the presentation Also I would recommend rehearsing it many times including in front of friends who are not in the class and know little about the topic Tell them to ask questions if things are unclear this way you can anticipate questions and even answer them before they are asked If students are confused about the topic in general there will be time to do a little bit of basic research Wikipedia etc to understand better or to realize that they need further clarification during the presentation Students should also look at the slide deck which is posted the night before on blackboard This will help them to get their wheels turning and get them in the mindset of the presentation This should allow them to be ready more quickly when the actual presentation starts so that they might be able to contribute to the discussion and earn those precious participation points This is the type of course that is made up of mostly junior and senior premed students who are looking to take upper level courses that they find interesting For the most part these students have mastered the basic concepts of biology and are looking for a more comprehensive look at global health and health policy through a variety of lenses highly mechanistic policy related and as a whole As such this course is great for students who are interested in global health and want in depth exposure to currently relevant topics This is also a great course for any pre med students who might not have any background in policy but are interested in its relation to medicine A good compliment to this course is MOL425 Infection Biology Burden and Policy This course is taught by the same professors but is twice a week for eighty minutes instead of once a week for three hours This class involves a somewhat shorter presentation and more instruction by the professors Although all topics relate to infection it has the same in depth and currently relevant quality ",

            "text": "The Fall 2014 course taught by Professor Donnacha Dennehy primarily encouraged creative music composition though the practical application of music theory fundamentals MUS 104 is designed for students with little to no background in music theory The first half of the course is primarily focused on basic theory such as music notation formation of melodies and simple harmony The second half of the course moves on to examine more complex harmonies and instrumentation in a variety of genres The most challenging part of MUS 104 is also what attracts many students to it you will go from having little to no experience in music theory to writing your own compositions by the end of the semester While the fundamentals are taught thoroughly at the start of the course the contents difficulty increases steadily throughout the semester Two lectures and two precepts make up the structure of the course totaling four hours a week Lectures are large and primarily focus on teaching the fundamental theory and listening to music that demonstrates it Precepts typically have approximately 15 other students and focus on explaining and practicing the theory discussed in lecture Students are expected to participate in discussion as well as ear training and sight singing exercises but the professor and preceptors are very understanding when it comes to singing ability Students should also be aware that they are required to sing perform compositions as part of precept participation While the course instructors understand there is great diversity of singing musical talent in the class they expect you to participate to the best of your ability even if youre not very comfortable singing in front of others However they do their best to make precept a comfortable and encouraging environment for all There are two to three in class quizzes in addition to weekly assignments that practice test the theory taught in class The course also has two large projects that take the place of the midterm final The fundamentals introduced at the start of the semester lend themselves to homework assignments that do not require a large time commitment for the first few weeks However as the semester progresses the topics become much more complicated In addition to the harder material students are expected to begin composing their own melodies harmonies and miniature compositions which require much more time and focus than the initial assignments Students may get caught off guard four to five weeks into the semester by the increased rigor and the high expectations for the midterm project which requires you to write a full song with a complex melody and a simple chord based background  First if you are completely unfamiliar with music theory put in extra time the first couple weeks to completely understand the core fundamentals such as reading music and scales These skills are essential for the entire course While you may be able to get by with just comprehending these fundamentals in the first few weeks you will need to be able to use them quickly as the weeks progress and the material becomes more complicated The reading material provided has a number of exercises to help you practice the theory It may seem intuitive but start the assignments as soon as possible Early assignments may only take fifteen to thirty minutes but later assignments are much more time intensive It can be hard to judge how long an assignment will take so starting the assignments early allows you to stay on top of the work you do In particular if an assignment involves composition expect to spend a significant amount of time working on it The weekly quizzes primarily test the students ability to memorize the theory presented in lecture While the main focus of the course is on composition these quizzes almost entirely avoid testing the students ability to compose music The student needs to be aware of the two areas of skill that are valued and when they should be applied At the same time the student needs to also be able to integrate the two skills when necessary While the professor is certainly knowledgeable and helpful your TA is the most important person to communicate with While homework and quizzes are the same across the class your TA is responsible for all grading In a class where composition makes up most of the work the grading can sometimes be somewhat subjective For that reason it is important to talk with your TA about what his her expectations are Your TA likely has expectations for how much you participate in precept in addition to what needs to be present in your compositions Dont be afraid to push the boundaries and ask your TA about attempting something that may be outside the assignment guidelines when you do your compositions If you are passionate about a form of music that isnt explicitly covered talk to your TA about using it in your midterm or final project For example a student in my class preferred to write and perform rap music While the course focuses on melody and harmony he was able to integrate rap into a harmonic background for his midterm project When you discuss your interests with the TA and explain what you would like to do he she is more likely to grade favorably This is a great course to fulfill a distribution requirement or just to increase your own knowledge of music A number of students in the class were already involved with music on campus but wanted the background to start writing their own music without taking two or three semesters of classes The course makes no assumptions on your musical background which makes it feasible for any student at Princeton By the end of MUS 104 you will have the necessary knowledge of music theory in order to write your own compositions The foundation built in this class makes it easy to write songs for a variety of instruments Even if there is something the class doesnt explicitly cover the skills from the class make it easier to learn about other musical topics For example by learning how to read and write music it is much easier to start teaching yourself basic piano Unfortunately this course does not count as a prerequisite for upper level music courses However if youre interested in taking additional or more advanced classes in the subject you can take the more intensive theory classes MUS 105 106 or take the music history companion class MUS 103 ",

            "text": "The first semester of Organic Chemistry Orgo has several purposes primary among them to underscore the fundamental concepts informing the year long sequence to teach the forms of visual representation used in the field and to introduce the empirical methodologies of chemical isolation and detection Lacking a formal syllabus the course is loosely organized into three sections with each section unit having its own two hour exam Each exam is cumulative and the focus of evaluation is on the students ability to use chemical information creatively synthetically and rationally in response to new situations That is exams and lab reports rarely test the recall of information in lectures the exams are open note open book the problems assume that students have a firm working knowledge of concepts and fundamental facts and testhow a student responds to material that is either new or presented in a novel way Students must learn torecognize what they know what may be known firmly what they do not know and how to determine therelevance of their knowledge in the context of new problems As a combination of theoretical principles schemas of representation formal drawings and empirical facts Orgo may be likened in some sense to learning a language The first unit introduces acid base chemistry of organic compounds carbon containing molecules the structure of bond orbitals hybridization and electron delocalization resonance stabilization all of which may be considered an essential grammar that informs nearly all aspects of the course for the rest of the semester and becomes increasingly critical for understanding the reactions explored in the second semester of the sequence When the course information sheet states that students should get help early if they are struggling it is for this reason the course is cumulative in that the principles of this grammar facilitate thinking ones way through unforeseen contexts and nearly all subsequent material The second unit presents the four historical and contemporary means of determining the structureof organic molecules mass spectrometry UV spectroscopy IR spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy Thecourse pivots in this second unit to explain the means by which these visualization techniques workexperimentally and to teach the ways by which the data from these methods allow one to determine theatomic composition and structure of a molecule During these lectures it seems much of the information ofthe first unit is left by the side but the problem sets and second exam stress a combination of the newmaterial with the concepts introduced previously Most loosely the problems ask that one be able tointerpret empirical data and provide rationalizations for the results based on concepts learned before The third unit completes the introduction to visual language representation of Orgo by teachingthe ways to draw cyclohexane rings and stereochemistry the ways to render unique three dimensionalstructures in two dimensions With this and the preceding two units of concepts the course proceeds tochemical reaction mechanisms drawn representations of rationalized understandings of chemicalreactions By the conclusion of the course students are expected to work forward from reaction materials toa product work backwards from a product to potential starting materials and or to fill in the intermediatestages between the two in addition to explain the concepts informing the reactions e g how acid baseinteractions delocalization structure and solvent reaction conditions are shaping the interactions Lectures and precepts are not mandatory but the instructors emphasize that exam material is drawn from lectures and more explanatory precepts than from the textbook Partially completed lecture notes are provided prior to lecture for students to complete during lecture the professors completed notes are posted later in the day after lecture Part of the difficulty in learning when and what assumptions are appropriate in problem solvingmay stem from what can falsely be interpreted as conflicting messages from instructors Students maymistake statements like the course is not about memorization as an excuse to give up memorization likework or they may interpret the textbook is reference material the lectures are the source material for examquestions as a statement authorizing them do less or no reading Much of Orgo can seem so novel thatstudents may doubt and neglect old effective ways of approaching course material like intensive readingand annotating of the textbook Consider what has worked best for you in the past as this description may be excessive Instructors list the chapters in the textbook that would correspond with the coming lectures in their lecture notes but often it is too late to read before class as the lecture notes are posted only the day before class As a result it is useful to skim the chapters beforehand so that the lectures would not be a rush of new information at 8 30am in the morning in the fall Orgo often is challenging in this regard too many students even stop attending lecture as they find it a blur without proper sleep and preparation While skimming make chapter outlines simply following chapter headings and subheadings not copying any definitions or diagrams During lectures use the course lecture notes provided to follow along Afterwards as the first exam approached use these two sets of notes the chapter outlines and the lecture notes and make a third set a simplified synthesis of the two Using the textbook copy out by hand a few tables and diagrams that seemed more integral to the types of problems seen in problem sets and in class Lectures provide a sense of what to copy from the textbook but without looking at the textbook before hand the lectures may have been too overwhelming Each exam is cumulative and the focus of evaluation is on the students ability to use chemical information creatively synthetically and rationally in response to new situations That is exams rarely test the recall of information in lectures the exams are open note open book the problems assume that students have a firm working knowledge of concepts and fundamental facts and test how a student responds to material that is either new or presented in a novel way Students must learn to recognize what they know what may be known firmly what they do not know and how to determine the relevance of their knowledge in the context of new problems In addition to the three exams that correspond to these units there is a final exam weekly labsand three lab reports weekly problem sets collected and marked completed but not graded weeklyprecepts weekly McGraw review sessions and an abundance of practice problems since all past examsare available to students The textbook covers all the material in the fall section of the course but does not pose questions in the way that exams and problem sets do The problems in Orgo do not conform to a simple format in which distinct variables may be cleanlyisolated and set up in an equation The analogy of a language is appropriate in this regard in that theprinciples and facts guiding much of the problem solving must also grapple with exceptions andirregularities Students must develop the ability to recognize what is relevant when given on the context but this is not as straightforward as it may be with physics or general chemistry where one must determinewhich formula is appropriate Rather Orgo is somewhat messier in that variables and considerations mustbe weighed against each other either to determine a process rationalize a product or intuit a structure Indeed the emphasis of the course is to get students to the point of a deep knowledge in which thinkinglike an organic chemist becomes a matter of intuition rather than explicitly conscious frameworks or recallof facts The course mantra of do more practice problems may give the impression that practice problems alone will confer the knowledge and skills to do well subsequently It is true that repetition and practice are crucial for success on exams but without reflection questioning and working with the course texts a combination of the textbook and lecture notes it is more likely that each new problem will seem disconnected or unclearly related to those that came before Without doing more active synthesizing even after doing numerous practice tests students may receive their exam check it against the key and ask in confusion how was I expected to know that To counter this broad issue of accidentally bypassing Orgos conceptual foundations I would encourage approaching the course as if all exams would be closed book Even if you prepare for practice exams with the goal of doing as much as possible without reference to notes or the text something on the test will likely require you to consult a chart table or diagram etc The exams are open book in this sense that students should be able to wade into an unknown problem make some headway before running up against a factual empirical uncertainty look up the information then proceed with the problem This type of understanding must be developed beforehand The single most effective practice I found for myself and among other to go about doing this is tomake a personal streamlined set of course notes The calmest Orgo students I met brought their text booksto the exams but they most frequently referenced their set of notes not the textbook and not theinstructors notes available on Blackboard The textbook or class notes might provide a necessary piece ofinformation like the relative acidity of Sulfur and Oxygen attached Hydrogens but students personal notesserve as a master set or master reference students are more intimately familiar with having authored andordered them Engage with the TAs Rather than spending entire afternoons stressed over one practice exam problem or lab report question walk over to Frick to utilize resource center hours The TAs will explain any concept that may be confusing and will guide you to the answer without imposing on your learning process Furthermore while Prof Semmelhack maintains a fast pace in lectures to cover the large volume of material the TAs have more time to focus on specific concepts and to elaborate on mechanisms that may be causing confusion The TAs were crucial to my experience in Orgo and I believe will be a valuable resource to future students Orgo offers what is for many a radically and exciting new way of thinking about the world and biologicalorganisms Even as students stumble through the course they do develop a distinct form of critical thinking one that pushes past rote pattern recognition to a lighter sense of comparing and contrasting probablecauses and effects Additionally and more concretely students learn to depict the world of organicchemistrythey learn to the system of lines dots letters and arrows that make up Orgos visualvernacular The course feeds directly into the second semester of Orgo which is offered in two sections onewith a biological emphasis and the other with a focus on synthesis of organic molecules Both are intimatelydependent on the concepts in the fall and both spring courses end up covering the same broad concepts and reactions but explore them differently ",

            "text": "This course focuses on two components of medical anthropology illness as a social ailment and the evolution of medical technology There is very little technical medical knowledge involved the class frames medicine in a social context Medical anthropology is the interaction of social environment medicine illness and culture Professor Biehl challenges students to think of medicine in a historical political and economic frame The courses reading content includes contemporary ethnographies medical journals media reports and films related to topics from historical medical anthropology to medicines modern transformation in the laboratory Each lecture is set up as an open seminar Laptops cannot be used and phones have to be turned off Professor Biehl invites open conversation about the readings and expects a weekly one page response based on the weeks topic and readings Half of the lecture includes Professor Biehl teaching and the other half is discussion Even though it is a lecture course with around 60 70 students it felt like an intimate seminar class To incorporate the anthropological aspects of this course two very unique term papers are required The class is not focused on memorization or testing so only two short quizzes are given during the semester The course introduces students to research using methods of medical anthropologists The first paper is an illness narrative which consists of interviewing and studying individual subjects and their situation This assignment allows students to see topics discussed in lecture highlighted in real life situations The second written assignment challenges students to examine medical technology from plastic surgery to the AIDS vaccine and its role in society The research paper is an opportunity for students to see how political and economic elements factor into a communitys perspective on medicine and illness Professor Biehl is really great about leading students through the content during lecture so listen to him when he emphasizes a concept and write it in your notes The presentations usually get posted on Blackboard but because a lot of the lecture content is discussion based a lot of listening and note taking has got to take place during lecture It can be difficult to stay engaged during a longer class period but it helps to be part of the discussion Also portions of lecture include short films and clips During lectures make sure to bring a copy of the reading because important passages and terms will be presented and it would be helpful to physically mark those down In addition the two quizzes Professor Biehl gives are based off the passages and key terms he points out from the reading so if you choose to mark your reading during class youve essentially completed a large part of your study guide for the quizzes Bringing your reading to class also gives you a chance to discuss more effectively You are more likely to speak in class if you have the content If you have marked passages before lecture and written short notes you have prepared yourself for the participation aspect of lecture In general to do well in this class it is important to stay organized and engaged Manage your time wisely and stay focused in lecture If you can stay on top of the reading and participate in lecture the rest of the assignments make more sense and become much more manageable The amount of reading required for this course is very demanding The heavy reading load can be overwhelming at first because there can be a lot of different terms and concepts within a single reading assignment The reading can also be dense and lengthy which makes it difficult to follow along concepts It is helpful to take concise notes and to mark the readings for important passages Students are not expected to memorize the material for this class but rather recognize the key terms or concepts in real life situations Professor Biehl wants you to be able to explain quantitative health trends using social political and economic factors Even though this sounds straightforward expect the two writing assignments to be challenging The illness narrative is very different than most written work because Professor Biehl does not expect nor want a traditional paper One of the most difficult aspects of the class was writing a paper with no clear thesis or central argument It can be hard to adopt the organic style of writing expected in papers Something I tried to do when I was having trouble writing papers for this class was turn to my readings as a model Anthropologists write differently from what I had done in previous courses Even though the reading is heavy it is filled with prime examples of the kind of writing expected for the class Read the guiding questions the professor emails the students prior to beginning the reading The questions are a great start to leading you in the right direction in terms of understanding the concepts and finding content to write in your weekly response Do not be overwhelmed by the amount of reading but know that you should not procrastinate Most classes you can get away with not reading the assignments but it makes lecture difficult to follow your weekly response poorer and retracts from your ability to participate in the open discussions during lecture which is part of your final grade Professor Biehl selects pieces of writing that are engaging and interesting For example one of the first reading assignments was a 350 page book I had until the next week to finish it so I had to make sure I allotted time each day to reading the book Before I knew it I was finishing up the last chapter a day early because at times I couldnt put down the book If there comes a week where you absolutely cannot do all the reading then I would recommend at least reading 2 3 of the assignment and having it down pat and skimming the rest The reading is integral to the entire course so plan ahead and stay organized Professor Biehl expects a lot from his students especially at the beginning of the course Do not be discouraged or overwhelmed Take advantage office hours and meet with the TAs and professor regularly Every other week at least I would try and meet with a TA and sit down with my weekly assignment and see what I could improve This sounds like a huge time commitment but the meetings never lasted more than 10 minutes and they were usually right after class Adopting these strategies earlier on will help your approach to the two writing projects Professor Biehl hands out the paper assignments at least a month before the due date so take advantage of all the time you get Because the expected writing style is so different than most classes it can be very beneficial to meet with a TA to discuss your topic and structure of your paper The professor and TA will not read drafts of your paper but if you present to them with excerpts or thoughts about how you will write your paper it will make the actual process so much more manageable This was one of my most rewarding classes As a pre med this is a great non natural science course that makes you think about all the implications involved in being a doctor that you may have never considered Even if you are not a pre med student this is still a great class to take It is an extremely well taught course that is filled with so much relevant and interesting content It also fulfills the EM distribution which can be really helpful for students who are not very interested in any philosophy class Do not be intimidated that it is a 300 level course I had not taken a single anthropology course before taking Medical Anthropology and the content was still very manageable This course also made me realize that I wanted to apply to be part of the Global Health and Health Policy program If you have any interest in pursuing a GHP certificate this is a great pre cursor to GHP 350 The courses have very similar assignments lecture structure and reading assignments I looked forward to researching for my papers and writing them which are rare for me since I do not enjoy writing The papers were so interesting to me because the process involved things beyond just writing For example the illness narrative required interviewing an individual and the research paper could be partnered with a CBLI project The approach to writing assignments in this class was practical hand on and unlike most writing assignments rewarding for the student ",

            "text": "The goal of the course was to develop an understanding of European Greek Balkan and Ottoman history through the unique vantage point that is the city of Thessaloniki The time period ranged from the arrival of the Romans in Thessaloniki all the way up till modern Greece Apart from studying history students were expected to gain awareness about historiography and being vary about different narratives presented about a particular historical topic especially regarding invisible pasts The foremost challenge is that Global Seminars although a unique opportunity in terms of travel and class size are truly research oriented courses The final paper was expected to be a research paper on a topic of interest relevant to the course material For this the Professor guided us to go out in the city and explore relevant material monuments museums artifacts and use the information learnt in class to do an analysis of the narratives presented by various sources The task is two folded 1 Identifying different narratives and examining them 2 Analyzing the different narratives and accounting for differences and similarities These tasks were of particular importance since it was an HA course An effective way to approach this is to start ahead of time Even though students were given a week after the seminar is finished to submit the papers the main resources lie in the city and it is best to take advantage of them The other approach is to make the most of the guided tours and visits as exhibitions and museums serve as great resources to identify the mainstream narrative present in the city country Lastly visiting professors are also great sources that help locate resources and can share valuable information relevant to the topic There was a midterm a final and a research paper Several visiting lecturers spoke to us and lectures were accompanied by tours and visits to historical monuments and neighborhoods Professor Greene decided the weekly readings on a week to week basis depending on the speed with which we covered the course material and the relevance of historical events to the course Since we were away from campus we had limited access to libraries and research journals Our main external resources were either guest lecturers local students museums and local Greeks who spoke English It is a great way to fulfill a course deficiency However it must be kept in mind that since it is a Princeton course compressed in six weeks it can also move very quickly and there are new concepts theories discussed regularly One adjustment that I had to make not being a history major was to be able to decipher the relevance and subtle differences between the multitude of narratives that we were presented by different sources The visiting professors our tour guide local students textbooks and the museums were in some way different to each other and it can get extremely confusing to keep track of them Professor Greene was extremely helpful with this and her lectures clarified everything and she was also available for office hours to answer questions A learning strategy that my colleagues and I employed was to share our notes and keep track of the different sources we read Organized note taking after doing the readings and then double checking it with the Professors lectures and other students notes was extremely helpful After the course students are definitely more vary when reading history books and different historical narratives Students are also more equipped to handle research papers and make the most of sometimes limited material due to language barriers or other hindrances The course also is a great exposure of studying in foreign lands and getting out of ones comfort zone to meet academic requirements Our seminar also included three local Greek students and interacting with them and listening to locals and their perspectives on history was fascinating I learnt a lot about research methodology and historical analysis I believe this is a tool that will be really helpful come Junior Papers and Senior Thesis Being aware of the sort of different analyses and strategies required while building causal relations is an extremely helpful tool while writing academic papers and understanding them To top it all Global Seminars are a great opportunity to get to know other Princeton Students in a new environment and make friends ",

            "text": "This class introduces students to molecular biology the study of the structure and function of macromolecules primarily that of proteins and nucleic acids The course examines the various experiments that led scientists to discover and subsequently fully understand these macromolecules In doing so students revisit the topic of the scientific method and learn to question natures ways Additionally the students learn about the applications of detailed knowledge and understanding of the macromolecules that are essential for life Logistically speaking there are two hour and twenty minute lectures each week and an approximately three hour lab period Lecture introduces and describes these applications while lab sections allow students to see first hand the usefulness of molecular biology The end of the course features Special Topic Modules taught by different professors in the Molecular Biology department that aim to show students the various research possibilities that become available if one pursues a molecular biology degree There are two midterms a final seven lab reports and twelve lab quizzes Finally there are optional problems sets and review sessions each week The Molecular Biology department offers two equivalent introductory courses MOL 214 noted above and MOL 215 Quantitative Principles in Cell and Molecular Biology The courses are equivalent in that they cannot be taken multiple times for credit but are different in the goals and purposes As the title of the course suggests MOL 215 is more quantitative and emphasizes the underlying physical and engineering principles of molecular biology For example students will learn to calculate the distance between the two backbones of DNA in both the minor and major groove On the other hand MOL 214 would only cover the structure of DNA and note that there are minor and major grooves that form when DNA is created Thus students that are more math inclined should take MOL 215 while those who are more detail oriented should take MOL 214 As with most classes at Princeton the amount of material covered in MOL 214 is vast Lectures move at a very fast pace and thus keeping up with readings can be quite challenging Additionally the first few lectures are often a partial review of AP Biology courses offered in high school and thus it is easy to fall in the I know this already trap and decide to skip the readings Finally although the problem sets provide examples of old exam questions no other exam preparation is provided and thus it is very difficult to anticipate what the expectations will be Thus when studying it becomes quite difficult to decipher what are superfluous details and what are the details you must memorize As noted above one of the biggest challenges of the course is to prevent oneself from falling into the I know this already or the I understand this from sitting in lecture traps Teaching in the form of lectures is often referred to as a passive learning in that students listen to a professor speak and accept the material at face value MOL is one of the few 8 30am classes offered and thus due to student exhaustion lecture often become even more of a passive exercise for many The introduction of Lecture Tools a program that allows students to answer questions posed by the professor and ask questions regarding the material has lessened the passive nature of lectures Yet as studies have shown that active learning allows for improved cognitive outcomes it is important for students to do more than attend lecture Every few weeks a list of required and recommended reading for the following lectures is provided a quick glance at the document reveals that there is much less required reading than recommended reading It is easy to convince oneself that because one understood it in lecture one can merely read the required reading and be successful Yet as noted above lecture is a mainly passive exercise so it is important to reinforce lecture material with not only the required reading but also the recommended Although in many classes this is not the case I have found that the recommended reading is particularly helpful for this course In suggesting it to friends that had done poorly on the first exam I was told The textbook is so helpful if only I had read it I would have done better on the exam When reading take notes draw flow diagrams to explain processes described and bookmark pages or concepts that were difficult After doing the readings I would recommend doing the problem sets posted for each section to make sure you have understood the topic If you do poorly on the quiz there are plenty of practice problems and explanatory videos on the books website Many students are unaware of this resource as it is not emphasized in class but I would definitely recommend using it either to further understand a topic or to gain practice for the exam Finally when studying for the exam look through the notes you took while reading the lecture slides retake the quizzes with the answers covered of course and meet with a study group to discuss concepts you are having difficulty with After completing this course you will have a basic understanding of the structure and role of the various macromolecules that are essential for life as well as the mechanisms required to create them The course is very well taught and very interesting as it explains the very precise workings of our cells For some this may be simply a requirement but for others it may spark interest in molecular biology or help in choosing between various majors ",

            "text": "The aim of writing seminar is to teach freshmen the Princeton writing expectations Although some students may be used to the classic five paragraph essay intro argument 1 argument 2 argument 3 conclusion often taught in high schools writing seminar stresses that Princeton professors free their students from this rigid format by assigning three types of papers an argument about a tension or puzzle between two narratives an argument about a single text using a theoretical lens and other contextualizing sources and a research paper Students will learn how to take advantage of the librarys resources a skill that will follow them throughout their liberal arts education Finally during finals each writing seminar section does a fun project For instance in my class we wrote personal narratives This course is challenging because students must be self reflective about the writing process by questioning and evaluating their own works They must figure out what the professor expects from their papers by listening closely to constructive criticism while also finding their own voices Last time management is a part of the hidden curriculum of this course Paper drafts are often returned with comments with only a few days before revisions are due so students must learn to start papers early Before seminars do the readings while holding a pen Take margin notes with summaries literary devices and their effects discussion questions and things you find confusing Create a list of at least five talking points for each seminar so that you are ready to participate Of course listen to your classmates and bounce ideas off of them rather than rattling off your own talking points as they become off topic During the seminar students will analyze texts discuss key writing concepts such as motive and critique classmates works I found the discussions critiquing papers to be very helpful even when we were not discussing my own paper because freshmen often make similar errors Although it might be challenging to stay focused when discussing some elses paper keep in mind that you should offer feedback as a courtesy to your classmate and also to force you to think critically about a piece of writing You may notice for example that Professor Young will ask What is this persons argument How do they support it Does it work What function does this section serve You may consider learning from Professor Youngs questions and comments by later asking yourself these types of questions as you write on your own After class make a schedule see more detailed suggestions below and be sure to take advantage of small chunks of time you have in between class and activities which may be another new concept because a lot of high schools do not have any breaks except for lunch It is not uncommon for freshmen to stay up all night finishing writing seminar papers However some freshmen soon learned the benefits of making a schedule and avoiding staying up late For instance a student might benefit from working in the library in between classes even if he or she only has 50 minutes to spare Using small free chunks of time can add up Also consider setting daily goals so you do not write the full paper in one night Perhaps one day the goal could be to take notes and write an outline the next day you can write three pages and the next day you can write two more pages and edit Do what works best for your own schedule but I cannot stress enough the value in making a plan with daily goals far before the paper is due so you do not end up writing a paper half asleep and you also have time to go to office hours for extra feedback I think this idea is new to a lot of freshmen because in high school assignments are often given and due the following day but in college there may be only be one big paper due in every few weeks so it is up to the students to take the responsibility of assigning themselves nightly work Furthermore I found the most helpful resource to be office hours In office hours Professor Young gives specific feedback so that you can refine your topic and thesis Dont be afraid to ask questions if the professor did not like working with freshmen he wouldnt be teaching writing seminar Going to office hours may be another challenge for freshmen because they may be intimidated by their professors because they are so smart but I can assure you that Professor Young loves teaching and encourages students to visit him In addition to office hours visit the research librarians They are remarkably nice and helpful when it comes to finding sources Also take advantage of the writing center for free one on one conferences with fellows who received As in writing seminar themselves Go to www princeton edu writing appt to make an appointment Some students have found it helpful to make appointments as soon as they know the due dates of their papers see syllabus for dates so that they can definitely get an appointment and so that they are forced to have a draft done early However the writing fellows can help at any stage in the writing process from brainstorming to editing drafts In short tuition costs already pay for office hours research librarians and writing fellows so it is silly to not take advantage of these helpful resources Expect to learn how to write a college level paper by being introduced to new concepts such as motive Because Princeton is a liberal arts college even engineers will be writing papers during time here This course is time intensive so students also learn the importance of time

            "text": "Description of Course Goals Curriculum As an introductory level course ECO 100 has one primary goal to familiarize students with the concepts of microeconomics and their applications High school algebra is sufficient mathematical background to take ECO 100 although understanding of calculus will be very helpful The fundamental principle of economics is the presence of scarcity limited resources do not allow everyone to have all the goods and services they want Microeconomics is the study of how we allocate scarce resources focusing specifically on local interactions involving households firms and goods Macroeconomics which is taught in ECO 101 is the study of how a national or international economy functions as a whole ECO 100 is an introductory level course so it does not delve deeply into any particular area of microeconomics Instead students learn the basics of each area Major topics covered in ECO 100 include supply and demand consumer choice uncertainty and risk markets and efficiency economic policy and political economy ECO 100 is usually the first college level economics course that a student will take especially because it serves as a prerequisite or requirement for many concentrations certificates and upper level courses Learning From Classroom Instruction ECO 100 is consistently one of the largest courses at Princeton by enrollment often reaching 400 students per semester Because of this the professor usually lectures from the front of a large room such as McCosh 50 To increase engagement Professor Rosen would call on individual students in the lecture hall to answer questions throughout the lecture Although the chances of being called upon to answer are low this practice was meant to ensure that students were keeping up with the content Another practice implemented by Professor Rosen was a no electronics rule to discourage students from checking social media texting or focusing on anything other than the lecture Because the material was often presented as graphs or equations taking notes with pen and paper is more effective than using a computer As an introductory level course ECO 100 with Professor Rosen moved relatively slowly and assumed no prior knowledge but the concepts build upon each other immediately so it is important to copy down even the most obvious or basic points such as the definitions of supply and demand for later studying Professor Rosen employed the chalk and talk strategy instead of using slides writing equations and drawing graphs on the blackboard while explaining them He also assigned a Pequod a bound workbook containing problem sets and notes as required reading Students would buy the Pequod and bring it to each lecture and precept where the professor or preceptor would refer to it frequently Readings were assigned each week from the Mankiw textbook Principles of Economics but these usually provided only background information that was repeated in lecture The textbook is more useful as a reference for exam preparation and as a source for extra practice problems Finishing the readings before lecture is not necessary but skimming them on non lecture days can help reinforce the new knowledge Learning For From Assignments Assessments The problem sets assigned by Professor Rosen were relatively short and straightforward but the exams were long and filled with tricky questions Problem sets are due each week in precept but it is a good strategy to start them the day after the previous precept while the new concepts are still fresh One point to keep in mind is that problem sets are intended to reinforce learning but exams are intended to generate a grade curve and weed out students Being able to complete problem sets easily does not necessarily translate to scoring well on exams Instead students should study and practice using old exams which are available online and through preceptors External Resources How To Use Them Princeton offers access to the online edition of The Economist accessible by going to www economist com princeton Professor Rosen also often emailed students news articles relevant to microeconomics but only as supplementary material rather than required reading However it is a good idea to read each article and practice simplifying them into the equations and graphs from class Students can also perform this exercise on articles they come across on their own simultaneously keeping them up to date on current news and improving their understanding of microeconomics Office hours are also a valuable resource and underutilized by the majority of students in such a large class They require students to take the initiative in asking questions but they offer the chance to do so in a one on one situation that is difficult to find within a large lecture course What Should Students Know When Selecting Courses In addition to being required for Economics and Woodrow Wilson School concentrators ECO 100 is also a prerequisite to required courses for Operations Research and Financial Engineering concentrators and students pursuing the Finance Certificate These four programs are some of the most popular at Princeton and ECO 100 is essentially the gateway course to all of them Some students will also take ECO 100 for general interest or as a distribution requirement These students should keep in mind that introductory lecture courses tend to serve as barriers to entry intended to determine which students will become Economics concentrators Most students in ECO 100 will earn B range grades but this should not discourage them from continuing to take economics courses out of interest Students might also find that they prefer a certain subject within microeconomics but it will receive only a lecture or two within ECO 100 Once this prerequisite is finished students can take more advanced courses that usually give out more As have fewer students and focus more on specific topics ",

            "text": "Professor Dweck wants his students to examine Jewish life in America from the mid seventeenthcentury through the late twentieth century He encourages students to read while keeping in mindauthor background authors main arguments how well the author supports the arguments connections to other texts themes and questions raised by the readings Each week surrounds a different theme Professor Dweck begins with introductory readings which are constantly referenced throughout the term so be sure to actually read them even thoughits just the first week and then moves to other themes Atlantic Jewish History Migration Back tothe Old Country Jews and Money the Americanization of Zionism the Invention of the Holocaust the Indictment of Ignorance American Jewish Cultural History as Collective Therapy Jews andRace and the Discovery of American Piety Throughout the course students will notice echoes ofprior readings and are encouraged to discuss these connections and their significance Thus thecourse is fundamentally comparative with concepts organized by theme What was challenging about this course was learning how to spot not only connections but also toevaluate their significance Luckily Professor Dweck is fairly forward so students receive instantfeedback and are able to tell if their comments are contributing to class discussion In particular Iwould recommend taking note of themes he gets excited about hint he will literally jump out of hisseat and run up to the chalkboard and comments that he does not feel move the class forward hint he will just say ok when you are done speaking and call on someone else In other words bytaking specific notes on the comments that make Dweck jump out of his chair you might be able tolearn how to make him jump excitedly around the room too I will discuss more particular strategiesfor class discussion in the LEARNING FROM CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION section Specific background information on the authors was very helpful In particular if you do a quickWikipedia search of the author before class and record facts such as their date of birth death date parental occupations parental countries of origins author country of origin authors occupation authors main legacies and how the authors main contributions relate to other themes of the course you will find yourself participating easily at the start of each class which particularly for people whoare not used to small classes that require a lot of participation is extremely helpful because it breaksthe ice or makes the shy students less afraid to speak up because they have already spoken a fewtimes before even 15 minutes have passed In addition background on what else was happening in the world during the time of the readings ishelpful to know but Dweck does not expect non history majors to necessarily be familiar with thisinformation There are two main components of this course seminar and assigned readings I SeminarThe purpose of seminar is to discuss the assigned readings In addition there are a few occasions inwhich each student gives a progress report on his or her research paper and the class gives feedback Sidenote a lot of people in my class would zone out while other people were presenting their progressreports but if you stay focused people will really appreciate any feedback you can give Students areexpected to take away analytical skills and be able to draw connections to prior readings highlightthemes and synthesize information For example Professor Dweck seems to appreciate commentssuch as I heard an echo from the World of Our Fathers reading from last week on pagewhen theauthor talks aboutwhich is significant because it relates the this theme of an idea that is importantbecause of Professor Dweck takes a lot of time designing the syllabus and thinking about whichreadings should be read together and what particular order Thus asking yourself reasons for readingthe assigned texts will also better prepare you for discussion For instance questions such as Why am Ireading this text with this other text Why are we reading these texts at this point in the term There areso many readings on this topic so why are we going over these particular texts I found helpful toconsider before class Seminar is difficult because the pace is fast meaning that if you are not a history major you mightinitially feel overwhelmed with people quickly saying a lot interesting comments with seemingly littleeffort so it can be hard to think in the moment about comments that will contribute to class To aidstudents learning particularly for people who are not used to small seminars that require a lot ofparticipation they might find it helpful to prepare comments ahead of time that make connections to otherreadings and themes as well as questions they may have Questions can range from specific to broadquestions to be discussed with the class In class students can take effective notes by not necessarilyrecording every word but again taking a step back and writing down what Professor Dweck seems toemphasize Hint he emphasizes ideas by talking louder repetition and saying Did everyone hearthat smiling nodding and writing on the board These obvious signs are helpful for people outside ofthe discipline who might have a harder time figuring out what is important Students can then use theirnotes to examine the structure of the class after the seminar They might ask themselves questions suchas How does Professor Dweck get his point across What point was he trying to make How did helead us there Evaluating the seminar can be helpful for writing papers because students can see howProfessor Dweck analyzes text which is similar to how you should be approaching the sources you willlater use for your research paper II Assigned ReadingsAs expressed above assigned readings relate closely to seminars They can be challenging becausethey often have a lot of information and ideas in addition to length To prepare for lecture students mightconsider listing themes from the syllabus and their notes in a row See the attached document for how Iorganized my notes Then as they read they can take notes in columns beneath the major themes After that step they can read their columns of notes and use a highlighter to literally highlight ideas thatconnect Using a few different colors of highlighters might help to emphasize connections For instance maybe notes relating to being uprooted will be highlighted in blue Finally I found it helpful to synthesizemy notes by making bullet points of ideas I could point out if hypothetically my entire class was asleep A wise history major once told me to prepare for seminars as if the entire class would be asleep Inother words pretend that you are meeting one on one with the professor and have to carry the entirediscussion Furthermore starring places in your notes that are emphasized in lecture is a helpful tool Of course listening and adding to your sheet of notes during and even after lecture can be interesting ways to learnas well However this last step honestly is for your own benefit rather than to help your grade becausethere are no exams in this class If you are concerned about time demands you might consider spendingtime after lecture working on your research paper instead of reviewing lecture notes In sum a busy student might read the long assignments efficiently by focusing on the larger themes see column note taking idea above and perhaps not getting bogged down in every single word Papers are about your own research topic rather than explicitly on the assigned readings Paperassignments are broad so students are free to choose almost any topic relating to Jewish Americanhistory I found the most helpful tool in preparing to write papers to be office hours Professor Dweck isvery accessible with office hours each week Sometimes office hours can be crowded the week beforethe paper but if you check in say for example every other week you will likely not have to wait in lineand you can receive feedback on every step of the writing process which Professor Dweck is more thanhappy to give One strategy might be to set fake deadlines for yourself To ensure that you meet these deadlines you can email Professor Dweck ahead of time although his office hours are walk in so emailing is reallyjust a way to hold yourself accountable For example every other week one might have a specific goal including finding a topic gathering sources taking notes from the sources writing an outline writing adraft or ultimately writing the paper If the goal that upcoming week is to have an outline for instance astudent might email Professor Dweck at the beginning of the week and ask if he or she can showProfessor Dweck an outline Thus the student will force him or herself to finish the outline in time foroffice hours If you visit office hours Professor Dweck will give a variety of helpful feedback includingtelling you if you are on the right track other sources or topics that you might consider potentialdifficulties you might encounter with your topic and specific comments on paper drafts In short definitely utilize Professor Dweck throughout the term to help identify and choose paper topics as well asgather and organize material for papers Furthermore the librarians are extremely helpful for findingsources see next section The librarians in Firestone are very useful resources for finding sources Everyone might considersetting up at least one appointment with a librarian once they know their topic You are paying for thisincredible human resource so why not take advantage of it Furthermore as mentioned above take advantage of the internet but do not tell Professor Dweck thatyou did since he hates the internet to do a quick background check on the authors of the assignedreadings Professor Dweck almost always begins class by asking questions about the authors so doinga quick Google search beforehand will prepare you to contribute to class right from the start Seespecific questions you should be able to answer on the authors under DESCRIPTION OF COURSEGOALS CURRICULUM Students can expect to learn about Jewish history in America by analyzing and synthesizing themes connections and context Such skills can be very helpful in future humanities courses as well as anyother task requiring large amounts readings at Princeton and beyond For instance science majors maybenefit because they will have a lot of background readings to do for independent lab work before theyget started with experiments Thus learning to synthesize is crucial in any field Of course countlesscareers after graduation require this skillset as well As for timing this course is flexible Outside of the weekly readings there is one midterm paper andone final paper Thus if a student is having a very busy week he or she might try to do the readings veryefficiently by skimming sections that do not seem to play a large role in the course and he or she can doless work on the paper for that week Another convenient aspect of the class is that it only meets once aweek so one can do the work at a time that fits into their schedule such as on the weekend if theirweekdays are hectic In short this course can be good for seniors who are trying to balance out theirbusy term with thesis research This course will give you an appreciation for the subject matter but also having an instructor who istruly passionate about his work He makes the class lively and fun by varying his tone speakingexcitedly and even making jokes Even though seminars are three hours I thought the time flew by andinsider note he often lets the class out a few minutes early In addition non history majors will gain an appreciation for history In particular science majors whoare usually taught with the emphasis on right answers will learn that history can be fascinating becausethere are often several sides to the same stories Last students should know that Professor Dweck hates the word identity Do not use it You will bepermanently exiled from the community ",

            "text": "At the most basic level PHY 205 is designed to introduce students to a new mathematical wayof looking at physics This course focuses on teaching the Lagrangian and Hamiltonianformalisms of physics and these are introduced in the context of Newtonian mechanics sostudents are already familiar with the underlying physics and can focus more on the newmathematical framework that is being introduced These formalisms are more abstract than theNewtonian formulation and so there is less frequently an associated physical thing with everymathematical concept In sacrificing intuitiveness though students gain a greater flexibility inthe kind of physical systems they can solve understand and can tackle more complicatedphenomena with greater ease Within the framework of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics there are a few major areas offocus that this class pursues One focus is on exploiting the relationship between symmetriesand conservation laws and deriving mathematical statements about conservation from bothqualitative and quantitative observations about the symmetry of a system Another focus is togive students greater comfort with harmonic oscillators and especially teaching the usefulnessof approximating a variety of different potentials as simple harmonic oscillators In a relatedway this course gives students a better understanding of Taylor series expansions as applied tophysics and potentials and gives students the tools to use Taylor series in simplifying lots ofcomplicated problems This course also teaches students how to expand physical laws intodifferent inertial frames including rotational and other non inertial reference frames thus givingstudents tools to do a wider variety of things and with a lot more mathematical ease than whenusing the Newtonian formulation of mechanics For the most part this course introduces any necessary or useful mathematical conceptsneeded especially those not covered in prerequisite physics classes However there are sometimes when the professor might assume more knowledge on a often mathematical topic than alarge portion of the class actually has and in these instances it is often good to stop and ask theprofessor to explain that topic in more detail especially as it applies to the physics beingpresented in that lecture This is especially true of concepts like Taylor series and Taylorexpansion with which many physics students are often only somewhat comfortable differentialequations much of which has already been taught in other prerequisite physics classes butwhich still might be challenging if a student hasnt had a differential equations class Fourierseries which are covered in adequate detail but perhaps not on a level to make everyone fullycomfortable with Fourier series and special relativity which isnt introduced until the very lastweek but which may be difficult to follow if the student doesnt have some exposure to itpreviously These are all topics that while not necessary to fully understand going into thecourse may present a bit more of a challenge if a student hasnt had prior or concurrentexposure to these concepts in another class The nature of this material is that it is best understood by learning a concept and thenimmediately applying that to one or multiple examples This is how the professor structureslectures teaching a general concept and then doing specific examples on the board There is alot to go through though and so the pace is extremely fast you cover about a chapter topic perweek One helpful method of note taking in this environment is to try and get down all theinformation spoken and written in some form into notes even if they dont seem supercoherent or you arent quite following the flow of a certain example This is probably easier inpencil paper form unless youre able to type up equations extremely quickly That way you cango back later and go over a section again if you didnt completely follow it in lecture or canlook again at an example that is particularly relevant to a specific homework problem In fact going back over the notes after class is a really good way to see what parts you did and didntfollow during the lecture and to either then reread your notes at a slower pace and understand what you missed the first time around or to figure out what things you need to ask about in thenext lecture or in office hours If you cant get everything you want to down in your notes atleast writing down all the steps in any and every example will be extremely useful This course tends to have a wide variety of students in it in terms of their physics and mathbackgrounds As such the professor will often assume a certain useful physical principle ormathematical tool is familiar to everyone and will use it Often he will check with the class tomake sure everyone is already familiar with the newly introduced concept or symbol butsometimes he wont and so its always good to speak up if something isnt clear especially ifthis is the first time its been introduced in this class The professor is quite receptive to this kindof request for clarification and does a very good job of going over these new concepts if he isasked Chances are if one person in the class hasnt seen a concept a large portion hasnt andthe professor is very good at backing up to explain things if he realizes that theres actually aneed to Often times students will be expected to be familiar with these concepts on homeworkand exams so if youre not the best way to remedy that is to ask the professor to explain it inclass Examples of such concepts include Fourier series Einstein summation notation the Levi Civita symbol the Kronecker and Dirac delta symbols Taylor expansions etc The lectures complement the readings well in that doing both will help your understanding a lot morethan doing just one or the other Lectures tend to go quite quickly and while they are chock fullof excellent information and examples its often hard to truly get everything you need out oflecture Ideally doing the readings before lecture would be preferable so youre alreadyfamiliar with the concepts and can pay special attention to clarifications that werent in the book or applications the professor goes over However reading after the lecture can also be usefulbecause it can fill in the gaps in what you inevitably will have missed during the lecture as wellas possibly some details that simply didnt get covered in lecture In theory all the necessarymaterial is in lecture but for a truly solid understanding of the material the book should be usedto supplement the lecture The book can also provide a source of questions to ask in thelecture and since there is a lot of new material being prepared with questions can beextremely helpful Assignments tend to do a rather good job of hitting on every important point from that week andas such they can be quite challenging especially if youre not completely comfortable with allthe concepts or are behind in your learning for that week These are best done by startingearly ideally the day of the last lecture that covers relevant material and spreading out thework Working with other people for at least part of the time is an excellent idea because oftenothers will see a shortcut simplification or even way to start the problem that you hadntconsidered and having exposure to these multiple strategies is really useful he next time youneed to do a pset or when on an exam Going to office hours especially for the professor butalso for the TAs can also be super useful in everything from getting started on a problem How do I even begin to approach this to understanding a concept Im doing this but Im notsure why to getting past a mathematical difficulty Is there a trick to this Making a weeklyhabit of going to office hours wouldnt be a bad idea Also utilizing your notes especiallyexamples done in class that you wrote down can be really useful for seeing a certain usefulmathematical trick or way to approach a problem The book can also be a good source ofexamples that might be able to push you in the right direction The exams tend to be structured as only 3 or so conceptual problems but broken into multipleparts They stress taking concepts that the course teaches and applying them in slightlydifferent ways than you have before As such a good understanding of the underlyingconcepts and not just a methodology for approaching problems is really important for preparingfor the tests Going through practice problems and understanding WHY a certain approach isbest or why this equation is applicable in this context is really useful preparation Occasionally simply searching the web for a different introduction to a topic can be useful Forexample for getting a hang of the equations of motion in a rotating reference frame it wasuseful to get a fresh perspective on how to understand what to do and how to think about it bygoing to the internet whatever you can find often web pages from similar classes at otheruniversities are most useful The nature and purpose of this course is to give you a completely different mathematicalframework with which to view mechanics and physics in general As such it has a bit of a steeplearning curve at first at the beginning can feel rather daunting If you can push through thisphase or even better devote yourself particularly strongly during this phase youll be able toreally appreciate the underlying math and physics that is actually very cool and rewarding It is avery demanding course that forces you to look at physics in a rather different way but it alsoopens up the door to countless really awesome insights and realizations as well as serving as the foundation of most upper level physics ",

            "text": "The Integrated Science Curriculum ISC is a unique introductory science course that gives studentsa mathematically rigorous and quantitative background in physics chemistry biology and computerscience The philosophy behind the course is to break down traditional barriers dividing the scientificdisciplines and appreciate the underlying connections and applications among them The traditionalphysics student will learn topics like fluid dynamics and statistical mechanics but the ISC physicsstudent will be able to apply that knowledge to model circulatory systems to neuronal proteinchannels The traditional biology student will memorize countless protein interaction pathways butthe ISC biology student will be able to mathematically and computationally model and characterizethose interactions ISC is a course that builds upon itself as the year progresses Although the lectures still start offseeming like standard physics curriculum it will very quickly tie into future topics The lectures onprobability will be applied to statistical mechanics the lectures on wave mechanics will be applied toelectricity and magnetism and all those topics combined will be applied to the final quantummechanics lectures Granted the primary focus of the class is physics but often taught in a way to beapplied to biological and chemical systems Lectures meet for 50 minutes every day Monday throughFriday There will be one lab and one precept per week and a Wednesday night problem setsession For the first half of fall semester ISC students will attend the COS 126 lectures on Tuesdaysand Thursdays Students planning on taking this course should be aware that the course moves at a very fast pace and is notorious for being one of the most demanding and challenging courses at Princeton A timecommitment of 40 hours per week is no exaggeration Although ISC is presented as an introductoryscience course with the only requirement being some knowledge of calculus a good amount ofbackground knowledge is assumed in many areas Having previously taken AP level sciencescourses in high school helps enormously Although equivalency credit is received for PHY 103 104 CHM 201 202 MOL 214 and COS 126 a good deal of the content from these courses are notcovered just due to practical time constraints for example rotational mechanics and most of biology or very superficially brushed by in a single lecture or two for example electrochemistry andacid base chemistry ISC is more focused on learning how to tackle problems and does not putmuch of an emphasis on memorization or knowing facts However admirable a principle this may be be aware that there is a lot of content that will be omitted from the curriculum that the traditionalintroductory sciences will covercontent that may have to be made up for upon entering higher levelclasses On the other hand ISC covers many topics that would not even be touched on in traditionalintroductory science coursessuch as statistical mechanics and quantum mechanicswhich willgive ISC students an advantage in upper level sciences The goals of ISC lectures are many but perhaps the main purpose is to achieve a fundamentalmathematical and physical understanding of each concept The professor will not just simply writedown the ideal gas law at the beginning of lecturethe lecture will build up from seemingly simpleconcepts to an intricate and elegant derivation In this way each lecture is almost like a revelation ofsome profound result with some interesting science history thrown in The pacing of the lessonsareto put it lightlyextremely fast paced Fortunately the content can mostly be found in thelecture notes available in its entirety at the start of the semester To get the most out of the lectures students should read the days lecture notes before class and once after class for good measure ISC is far from just theoretical derivations though The theory learned in class is often tied toexperimental practice in lab The lectures on Einsteins diffusion relation are followed up by a labreproducing Jean Perrins Nobel winning experiment confirming Einsteins theory The lectures onprobability are followed up by a lab reproducing the also Nobel winning Luria Delbruck experiment using clever statistics to calculate mutation rates in yeast The ISC labs are an invaluable tool foranyone interested in research as it really throws the student into the process of collecting analyzing and presenting data The first few lab reports will feel especially difficult as students are not yetfamiliar with the software used to analyze data and draw figures ImageJ and Matlab and how towrite in a scientific style but by the end of the year ISC students will have a huge advantage overtraditional science students in doing and presenting research ISC precepts are meant to extend the theory taught in lecture and apply them by setting up deriving and solving very difficult equations related to real world systems for example TIRF microscopy orthe Ising model for ferromagnetism The content covered in precept go way beyond what would everbe taught in an introductory science course or sometimes even any undergraduate course for thatmatter Although much of it goes over the students heads precepts teach how to tackle problemsthat have no standard solution how to set up a differential equation what strategies or clever tricksthere are to solve them how and when to make appropriate approximations A common struggle is toknow when to use certain mathematical tools to solve equations how do you know to make a Taylorapproximation here How do you know to separate into independent variables here or that a Fouriertransform is useful there By going through so many challenging problems precept gives studentsexposure as to what tools and techniques are available and useful in what situations The weekly problem sets are an essential component of learning in ISC They are notoriously difficult often unconventional problems Whereas a traditional introductory science problem set will be aboutknowing facts or applying equations ISC problem sets are far more open ended for example howbig can an organism be before it needs a circulatory system or how many air molecules hit yourhand every second Such problems require students to independently set up equations makeappropriate approximations and perform nonobvious mathematical manipulations These are thetype of skills that will be tested on the exams which contain problems very similar to those found onproblem sets Problem sets should always be worked on in groupspart of the spirit of ISC is that science is acollaborative process gathering on the input of several minds There is a required problem setsession every Wednesday night which inevitably turns to Thursday morning where everyonegathers to work together Having extra people around is especially useful when it is often the casethat no one knows how to even start tackling the problem People will approach the problems inseveral ways and many of those ways will not lead to an answer Though the failure is oftendispiriting it is really the struggle and the genuine effort students put in that help them grow andimprove as scientific thinkers As valuable as the collaboration is however students should be waryof relying too much on itthat is giving up too easily on a problem and waiting until someone elsefigures out a solution No one individual ever figures out the solution to every problem independently but every individual should give their best try even if it gets nowhere its often just as valuable toknow what not to do and why certain techniques dont work Problems often take a good deal ofextra learning and research outside of what is covered in lecture and precept a fact that is a commoncomplaint among students Besides problem sets the other main source of workload in ISC is the lab reports due every otherweek These lab reports are far beyond what is expected in any other introductory science class Each ISC lab report is essentially a full scientific paper with an introduction methods results anddiscussion figures and conclusion The first few labs are especially challenging as students are often quite unpreparedly thrown into performing data analysis with programs such as ImageJ andMatlab In the past years however the lab curriculum has been revised to ease students in moresmoothly the first lab report for example only required an introduction figures and conclusion There is however definitely still a period of adjustment for the first two lab reports Expect to spend20 hours writing a good lab report The takeaway from ISC lab however is enormous Students arefaced with the frustrations that inevitably come with any real research and learn to analyze andpresent data at the level of actual scientific publications Your fellow students are by far the most valuable resource in ISC You will be working together withthem on both problem sets and lab reports and perhaps one of the best aspects of the class form avery close community As much as the professors pride ISC with being a revolutionary nontraditional class sometimes it isstill helps to refer to a more traditional text that sets a better foundation of basic concepts Forexample many students used Dills Molecular Driving Forces as a reference for statistical mechanicsand thermodynamics and Griffithss Introduction to Quantum Mechanics though be warned one ofthe professors really does not like Griffiths Because ISC covers so many topics it is better to eitherfind online copies of alternate textbooks or borrow them from Lewis Library ISC is a uniquely challenging course Students who make it through gain an aptitude for quantitativereasoning become familiar with the process of scientific research and feel a sense a community andconnection unparalleled by those brought about by any other class That said the class is verychallenging a huge time dedication and will at times be incredibly frustrating If you arequantitatively inclined passionate about science or enjoy doing research this class will be aninvaluable experience The second semester of ISC makes use of vector calculus for electricity and magnetism and linearalgebra for quantum mechanics so having knowledge on those subjects definitely helps Many takesome type of math concurrently MAT 201 203 for vector calculus and MAT 202 204 for linearalgebra though keep in mind that MAT 203 204 sequence is another challenging time consumingclass The full year ISC sequence gives equivalency credit for six classes PHY 103 104 CHM 201 202 MOL 214 and COS 126 If you only take the first semester then you will only receive credit for PHY103 and CHM 201 Note that these equivalency credits are not universally acceptedengineers mayneed to take additional classes to fulfill their requirements depending on their specific concentration Although ISC is a huge time commitment students certainly find time to take other challengingcourses and participate in extracurricular activitiesorchestra dance groups acapella theatre varsity and club sports or doing research in a lab There is a limit though on how much one can doand maintain a healthy amount of sleep Still there is nothing stopping an ISC student from also livinga full college life ",

            "text": "a Professor Dolven and Kelly Swartz wanted students to learn how to botheffectively analyze texts through close reading techniques and createclear papers with well supported theses describing their observations allwhile getting an introduction to foundational literature in the Westernworld This course is a mandatory prerequisite for the English department b The course was organized chronologically from the 14th to the 18th centurywith each unit lasting 1 4 weeks focusing on a piece of British literature The course studies five works in 12 weeks c The course is not incredibly comparative Each unit is mainly studiedclosely in and of itself however a portion of time is spent connectingworks to their predecessors in the course and identifying connectingthemes throughout all of the works d If ones precept is early on in the week it can be very challenging to readthe chapters assigned and analyze important moments or themes inBlackboard posts if one is unfamiliar with Old English or these older texts and has not yet had Professor Dolvens lectures on the text that week tohelp guide ones focus when reading To feel more comfortable with theweeks reading and subsequent Blackboard posts it can be useful to emailones preceptors with questions or take a look at precept lecture notes orprevious weeks Blackboard posts for hints as to what topics might be ofinterest Also for the six 2 page exercises that are due over the course ofthe semester a good strategy would be to wait until the 2nd or 3rd week of aunit to write an exercise so that one is more familiar with the importantthemes of a text before approaching the assignment e One hidden expectation in the course is that students were familiar withstories from the Bible Many of the pieces of literature either directlyreferenced or contained allusions to Biblical stories and students werequestioned on them and their significance in precept and in Blackboardposts A background skill that would be helpful for learning in this coursewould be an ability to read a prior familiarity with Old English and orShakespearean English as the first three pieces of literature were writtenin a very different style than modern English with the last two worksbeing only slightly easier to read and comprehend a Lecturei Lectures are often in depth analyses of a few passages from thatweeks reading with a bit of time at the end spent discussing thetext in general Students are expected to learn analysis techniquesfrom Professor Dolvens passage analyses and pay attention toimportant moments of allusion and influence genre and form metaphor and allegory rhetoric sexual politics and narrative ii The lectures are meant to identify important themes fordiscussion in precept and give students an example of how to studya text in close detail for more complex analysis an essential part ofthe structure of the two five page papers a midterm and a final that are required in the course Because lecture slides are made upof mainly excerpts of important passages it is useful to take noteson which passages are used to provide good study material for thefinal exam which contains an identification and analysis sectionmade up of significant quotes from the texts iii Lectures are set up in essentially the same way every day abrief discussion of plot 40 minutes of Professor Dolvens analysisspecific passages from the text that are displayed on slides andthen five minutes of wrap up larger picture discussion iv The passages discussed in lecture are often not inchronological order from the text so it is not always easy to get alarger picture of the themes or importance of the text for that week Or the themes addressed in lecture are seemingly separate fromthe prompts for the weekly Blackboard posts so it can bechallenging to understand or approach the Blackboard postassignments without any grounding from themes in lecture v To practice the identification of important passages in texts students can try highlighting excerpts from the weeks reading thatthey think will be discussed in lecture In lecture they can thenmark what excerpts Professor Dolven chooses to discuss and writedown why they are important Students can then look over theirnotes from lecture and their notes on the text to see what topicscould be brought up in precept discussion b Precepti Precept allows students to more thoroughly discuss ideas ProfessorDolven mentioned in lecture and address parts of the reading hedidnt have time to get to Students are expected to learn from eachothers reading and analysis strategies by listening to what theyhave to say in precept and reading each others Blackboard posts ii In addition to thoroughly analyzing themes from lecture precept gives students more time to ask questions about the readingor the writing assignments as questions are not especiallyencouraged in lecture iii There were not common organizational patterns in precept The preceptor made a consistent effort to keep the sectioninteresting by introducing new group partner activities each weekto approach the text in different ways A consistent element ofprecept was the opportunity to ask questions of the preceptor forany problems of understanding iv Precept can be challenging if students feel they dont fullyunderstand the text or if they dont feel they have graspedimportant themes or topics but feel pressure to bring up new ideasin precept v Doing the reading is obviously an important part of havingsomething to contribute and being able to understand otherscontributions in precept Writing down questions that arise inlecture allows students to refer back to their notes and askquestions in precept If students are struggling with Blackboardposts they can take notes on methods of analysis that their peersare using for ideas and take notes on what important topics arebrought up in precept that were left out of lecture Precept is alsomore of a time of comparison of texts than lecture and it isimportant to take note of overarching themes throughout thecourse as these observations can help one with completingexercises Blackboard posts papers and studying for the finalexam c Assigned readings textsi By reading the texts each week students are expected to developskills to better read and understand older texts and analyzeliterature ii The assigned readings are the core of the course fromwhich analysis in lecture precept papers Blackboard posts exercises and the final exam extend iii Each text is divided into sections in the form of chapters acts tales etc making it easier to follow and analyze iv The texts are not written in modern English making itmore difficult to read and understand It can be challenging to notget discouraged or frustrated by the added time it takes to completethe readings due to this aspect v Attending and note taking during lecture can help studentsunderstand main themes in a text that will inform the next weeksreading Precepts allow students to clarify aspects of the text theydo not understand give them an opportunity to expand preliminaryideas they have had while reading and give them a basis on whichto continue their reading a Blackboard posts due at 5pm the day before precept i Purpose to ensure students finished weekly reading and to give aweekly opportunity to practice in depth analysis of apassage excerpt from the text ii Challenges Depending on the prompt it could be difficultto write a post if one has not understood all of the reading for thatweek and has not yet had lecture to help identify important themesto guide their analysis iii Strategic approaches Ways to address difficulties increating Blackboard posts is asking the preceptor for clarificationon the prompt looking over previous lecture precept notesconcerning the text to identify relations to this weeks reading andexpand on those ideas in the context of more recent chapters b Exercises 6 due throughout the semester 2 pgs each turned in atprecept i Purpose to give students practice at writing concisely whenanalyzing a specific passage from a text ii Challenges It can be difficult to dive deeply into theanalysis of a passage when one only has two pages of space Inaddition it is not ideal to write exercises twice in two weeks asone will not receive his her first exercise back before turning in thesecond so there is no opportunity to learn from past mistakes Also the prompts change weekly and are only released a weekbefore so it can be challenging to choose which prompt to addressif one wants to take the chance and wait another week for a morepalatable prompt iii Strategic approaches As stated previously it can be quiteuseful to wait a week or two into a unit before writing a exercise so that one has time to better understand the themes of the textfrom several lectures and precepts before taking a stab at analysishim herself This is preferable to writing an exercise that is dueduring the first week of a unit when students have received little tono direction of what to focus on in the text Also take a look atpreviously written and graded exercises to get an understanding ofwhat your preceptor is looking for and what your strengths andweaknesses are in your writing These steps will help guide youwhen writing papers for the course and will give you anopportunity to ask your preceptor clarifying questions for how toimprove your reading and writing abilities c Papersi Helpful Strategies for Preparing to Write1 Professor Dolven provides model papers that are gradedwith comments for students to refer to for structure andwriting style when crafting their midterm and final papers ii Identifying and Choosing Paper Topics1 Although students can suggest their own prompts with theapproval of their preceptor and Professor Dolven Professor Dolven provides a list of essay questions for eachassignment and encourages students to pick one to addressfor their paper 2 One should choose a topic that they are interested inthinking more about or discusses an aspect of the text thatthe student feels most confident in being able to analyzebased on their own choices for Blackboard posts exercises or discussion topics in precept Picking a familiar topicallows one to review already written material and developmore ideas instead of having to start from scratch iii Gathering and Organizing Materials1 The papers are analyses of one passage in relation to thewhole of the text so there is no outside research necessary It is helpful to use notes from lecture and precept that relateto the paper prompt one has chosen in order to spark ideasfor further analysis in ones paper 2 It can be useful to print out the passage that one is going toanalyze for the prompt and read through it multiple timesfor different parts important aspects to the language andword choice images evoked references to other works orother parts of the text from which the passage came etc After several read throughs one will have a wealth ofdifferent ideas and can then pick and choose which themesto address in the paper It is important to keep referringback to the prompt to make sure ones ideas stay on track towrite a concise and focused paper d Testsi Kinds of Problems and Thinking Required 1 There is the potential of pop quizzes that are made up ofone short answer question about an aspect of the currentunit There are between one and five pop quizzesthroughout the semester They require the ability to recallimportant themes from that weeks reading and or lectures 2 The final exam has a quote identification section that asksstudents to say where the quote is from who is speaking and the significance of the quote in the text This section ismainly straightforward recall of plot structures from booksand important quotes addressed in precept and lecture 3 The essay section of the final exam requires students torespond to essay questions that ask about larger themes inthe units and what themes are universal across the differenttexts This section requires students to apply themes fromthe course to familiar questions using examples from thetext as support for their arguments 4 The literary keywords identification section of the exam isthe smallest part Students must define and give an exampleof the keyword in one of the texts studied during thesemester This is a straightforward recall of the definitionof phrases and an instance of that idea in the text Studentsshould study for this part of the test using flashcards withthe definitions of words and examples from the text on eachcard ii Organizing and Synthesizing Materials to Prepare for Exam1 Although exercises and papers are not the most useful tohelp ones studying the quotes one has amassed fromlecture and precept notes are incredibly important as theyare likely to be picked for quote identification and analysison the final exam Reviewing important quotes in each unitthat define important themes or plot points in the textallows one to become familiar with not only the quotes thatwould be used for one part of the exam but are also reviewfor the second portion of the exam in which questions oflarger themes are discussed 2 Reviewing quotes and their importance from all of thepieces of literature read in the course allow one to seeoverarching themes contained within individual quotes Itcan be useful to make a chart of overarching and individualthemes on one axis and the names of each text on the otheraxis One can then mark off which texts contain whichthemes and identify common topics addressed among theliterature as well as what each text discusses uniquely Forfurther studying one can find quotes from their notes toattach to each topic and or text to support back up theirobservations iii How Course Assignments Help to Prepare for Exam1 The essay portion will ask for application to familiarquestions from the course No topic or theme on the examshould be unfamiliar to a student who has completed thereadings and assignments Students may be asked to weavetogether multiple ideas from different units that have beendiscussed in precept and lecture This type of synthesiswould be new but all with familiar elements a Professor Dolven encourages students to use the Oxford EnglishDictionary to look up unfamiliar words when reading the older texts Healso provides a link to a modern English translation of The CanterburyTales through Blackboard b Informally it can be quite helpful to review a summary of a chapter or textbefore beginning a weeks reading so that one spends less time trying tounderstand what is going on plot wise and can devote more energy toreading between the lines and identifying allusions and symbols in thetext a Students can expect to develop their ability to read non modern English an ability that will serve them in future English courses If peoplethoroughly enjoyed the texts in the course they may be interested intaking a Medieval Studies course to explore other Old English texts b Students should understand that even if reading requirements dont exceed150 or 200 pages a week normally much less the reading is much moredifficult than a modern novel It can be a frustrating struggle even for fastand experienced readers or people certain of their future concentration inEnglish c The most valuable benefit I took away from the course was more practice and learning by example of how to analyze a piece of literature and aswell as practice in writing clear yet complex English papers d Miscellaneous One should not take the course just to fulfill an LAdistribution requirement if one is not considering being an English major unless one likes older texts and British literature This is a large lecturecourse due to it being the only mandatory course for all English majors Personally I prefer English seminars because literary analysis can be verysubjective and having a three hour slot weekly to discuss literature withno more than 15 other people allows you to have time to analyze the textmore in depth versus hearing someone elses interpretation and thenrecapping it in precept No one assignment makes up more than 20 ofones grade which can be comforting to students because no oneassignment will kill the final grade However this also means one must bethorough and consistent in ones work throughout the semester ",

            "text": "a Professor Garon would like students to gain an understanding of Japanscultural economic and political experience of the 20th century over thecourse of the countrys rise up to World War II fall and subsequentreconstruction after the war The importance of understanding historythrough Japans eyes was emphasized throughout the course as well asbeing able to break down Japans history in three genres social political and economic b The flow of the course was a progression through time from 1850 topresent with each lecture consisting of details of Japans experienceduring one time period inter national event or social political economictopic c The course is comparative in the way it asks students to consider Japanshistory through its own perspective versus what they have learned aboutJapan through the eyes of the West The content is ordered chronologicallyand also sequentially for example four or five lectures cover the sametime period during World War II but address different facets of Japanesesocial political and economic life during this time d The course was quite dense with information in lecture and in readings forprecept Thus it became important to distinguish what was worth studyingfor long term memory purposes It is helpful to write down a summary ofwhat each reading discusses so that one has a clear idea of the argumentfor comparison to other readings or lecture material without having toremember specific details from each reading Because the majority of themidterm and final exam grades are from a long comparative or change over time essay with only a small section containing IDs for importantpeople or processes students should not try to remember every figurementioned in lecture or the reading and should instead focus onunderstanding long term social economic and political trends e There were no hidden demands for this course though of course it wouldbe helpful to have an understanding of Japanese culture politics andeconomics This knowledge is no way a prerequisite most students whotake the course have never previously studied Japan in depth a Lecturei Lectures were important to give historical context for weeklyreadings that were often primary sources for precept Students arenot expected to remember every detail but instead be able toidentify common trends and important figures events from all ofthe lectures ii Lectures give context for the assigned readings and are thesources for the identification questions on the midterm and finalexams They also are helpful for allowing students to be exposed tothe wide range of topics and themes that they can further pursuefor their final research paper iii Professor Garon prepares a lecture outline and prints it outeach morning before lecture Students pick up the outlines whenthey come into class They are not provided online and aretherefore an incentive to come to class Although each lecture is adifferent topic his outlines break down the lecture into sectionsand subsections so students have a visual aid to help follow hislecturing iv Professor Garon is a dynamic lecturer and moves throughlectures quite quickly v To combat feeling lost or overwhelmed by informationduring lecture students can review the syllabus before each lectureto see what the main theme of that lecture is They can then referback to past lecture notes to identify similar themes In addition they can arrive to lecture 5 10 minutes early to look over thelecture outline from Professor Garon to get a groundedunderstanding of what the lecture will entail and thereby prepareones notes or note taking mindset to focus on the important pointsin the ensuing lecture To help solidify what they heard in lecture students can type up their handwritten lecture notes ProfessorGaron does not allow computers in class and integrating them intoProfessor Garons outline on a Word document b Assigned readings textsi Assigned readings in the Pequod packet and outside texts requiredfor the course give students an inside look at Japanese social political and economic culture and practices because a majority ofthe material is primary sources While students are not expected tomemorize quotes from each text each serves to inform the studentto a different aspect of Japanese life and history so students shouldhave a general knowledge of the sources with the skill of beingable to cross compare and link material different sources toprovide a more holistic picture of Japanese history ii The readings go more in depth of what the lectures discuss and serve as the basis for discussion in precept iii The readings are paired up with lectures that are of thesame topic so they are arranged chronologically in the Pequodpacket Other than that there are no other organizational patterns iv There is a significant amount of reading each week fromthe packet and outside secondary source texts Not everything iscovered in precept each week because the discussion might beprolonged for certain texts and others might not get covered v To help spur connections between lecture material and theassigned readings students can mark what is familiar in thereadings from what they have heard in lecture and or mark whatthey hear in lecture that relates to what they have read for preceptthat week If students are having trouble finishing all of thereading they can focus on the primary sources in the Pequodpacket over the secondary textbook by Andrew Gordon as it is avery informative text that has similar information to ProfessorGarons lectures Students are encouraged and should feelcomfortable asking questions about what they dont understandfrom lecture or the readings marking down questions in lectureor at home beforehand can help one to remember to ask them During precept it is helpful to take notes in the Pequod packet sothat one remembers which reading correlates to their observations It is also useful to have their lecture outline for that week outbefore during and after precept to be able to easily refer back to ato lecture for background to the assigned readings 3 Learning For and From Assignments and Assessmentsa Papersi Strategies Helpful for Preparing to Write1 There is only one paper in the course and it is not meant todirectly correlate to any of the lectures or assigned readings it is an opportunity for students to investigate an area ofmodern Japanese history that interests them Thus goingover notes or prior readings will not directly help withcrafting the paper ii Identifying and Choosing Paper Topics1 The best strategy to prepare to write is to choose aninteresting topic about which one has many questions 2 Apart from being a curious historian it is helpful tounderstand the expectations for a historical research paper It is very helpful to run ones thesis or idea by ProfessorGaron before starting to make sure that one has an adequatechallenge to research not too simple nor too complex aswell as to receive suggestions for which resources toaccess 3 In addition to his suggestions in office hours he includesappendices on the course syllabus containing hundreds ofsources in different areas of Japanese history iii Gathering and Organizing Material For Papers1 The main expectation is that students find direct quotesfrom sources to support their arguments It is effective toread sources with an idea of what ones thesis in order toknow what quotes to mark to refer back to later Thisallows ones thesis to evolve as new ideas are discovered but still maintain the ability to go back to important quotesthat support ones arguments b Testsi Types of Questions Asked Types of Thinking Required1 On the midterm and final exam a portion of the credit isderived from ones definitions to five to ten terms that arenames of important figures or concepts from the course This is a test of straightforward recall 2 The best way to study for this is to go through lectureoutlines and ones lecture notes and identify recurringfigures ideas Then one can make flashcards with the termon one side and the significance on the other Over thecourse of the semester it can be helpful to mark a term orname that Professor Garon verbally deems important as heoften does in lectures 3 The second portion of the midterm and final exams is theessay portion Here students are asked to compare andcontrast or remark on the change over time of a social political and or economic concept in Japanese history from1850 present This is an example of application oflecture reading material to more complex questions 4 The best way to study for this portion of the exam is first togather ones lecture notes and lecture outlines fromProfessor Garon or hopefully one has consolidated bothonto a word document in a stratified format as suggestedpreviously Then go through the notes three times andeach time use a unique highlighter color to mark significantfigures concepts and events that relate to change over timein the social political and economic realms of Japanesehistory It is helpful to use the same printed notes for allthree highlighted revisions so that in addition to separatelyfollowing the chronological evolution of social political and economic trends the student can return after finishingto investigate the conversion of all three processes at eachtime period This is a great way to get a larger picture viewof change over time and prepare for similar essayquestions It is also helpful to go back to the syllabus andask oneself the question Professor Garon poses for theweek if you dont know the answer go to yourhighlighted packet of notes to see the social political andeconomic breakdown of a good response 4 External Resourcesa Everything that is helpful to the course is contained in the required orrecommended reading from Professor Garon but if people have furtherquestions or concerns they should talk to him directly in office hours forhelp 5 Things to Know For Course Selectiona By taking this course students can expect to become fully immersed inJapanese history and develop the ability to think about world events froma non Western perspective The final research paper topic can serve as anexcellent jumping off point for future independent work if someone reallyenjoys their subject and the paper assignment itself is a good exercise intime management and development of research based writing skills b The readings are not mountainous but certainly not limited or easy to reador understand so students should expect difficulty in being able to finishall of the reading every week for precept but also be able to still havepoints to contribute even if they do not finish on time Apart from weeklyreading for precept there are no assignments except for the final paper soit is easy to set up a weekly schedule for ones work c I took away the ability to understand the reasons behind Japans stance inWorld War II and a new interest in gender relations and roles in Japan Ialso realized how important it was for me to handwrite then type up thenhighlight my lecture notes so that I could review information multipletimes It was also reinforced that I needed to write down a 2 3 sentencesummary of each assigned reading so that later on in the semester Iwouldnt have to reread my entire Pequod packet to remember importantpoints from precept

origins structureand function of the global biosphere evolution animal form and function interactingsystemsecology and interacting systemsbehavior Lectures meet three times a week 50minutes each time Course content is delivered in the Monday and Wednesday lectures Fridaylectures are devoted to design problems Design problems are complicated ecological evolutionaryproblems with no clear answer i e is blood clotting too complicated to have evolved Students areencouraged to work in groups and submit their individual response by the end of the day The coursehas a weekly 3 hour lab component Lab reports are usually limited in length and are dueapproximately every second week Labs typically require field work i e studying succession in theInstitute Woods or working with animals i e studying aggression in crawfish There are noprecepts for the course The goal of the course is to help students explain the world around them How did things come to bethe way they are today Why are plants and animals structured in the way that they are Whileanswering these broad spectrum questions may seem daunting in the beginning the professors aimto make the ecology evolutionary concepts approachable and interesting for all students Forinstance lectures are often framed with questions such as why do adults not look like big babies thelecture then proceeded to teach about the importance of scaling to meet the survival demands oforganisms Even if students are not planning to concentrate in the department it is very gratifyingthe walk away from the class with an ability to scientifically explain interesting factoids such as thegas concentrations in our atmosphere and conduct informed debates about controversial issuessuch as evolution The lectures in this course are supplemented with assigned reading One of the reading materials forthe course is an introductory biology textbook Most students who have taken AP IB biology in highschool or MOL 214 will have already learned most of the material in the textbook The reading isaimed to fill holes in basic biological concepts for students who do not have a biology background The other reading for the course is Richard Dawkins book The Selfish Gene Both professors willlecture extensively drawing both examples and concepts from the book The book is a veryinteresting read and is a valuable study material While the lecture material is concept examples based the exams are not based on regurgitation oflecture material Students may be tempted to memorize the lecture slides but the exams areanalytical in nature Students are asked to use the concepts learned in class to explain a naturalphenomenon or to find apt examples that would help make sense of an evolutionary concept Thereis one midterm and one final exam Both exams are entirely short answer short essay in format andask students to reflect carefully on their body of accumulated knowledge before drafting an answer EEB 211 lectures are structured such as that the concept that will be covered is addressed within thefirst five minutes of class Subsequently the professors will explain the concept using examplesfound in nature It is easy for students to lose sight of the conceptual big picture and become buriedin the list of examples especially since most of the class is dedicated to presenting the examples As a result being attentive at the beginning of lecture is important for making the most of theclassroom time The professors will teach from prepared powerpoint slides that are both printed for the students andaccessible online in a digital format to facilitate note taking in preferred format The slides are veryminimal and act as a guideline for the flow of the lectures Students may choose to supplement theslides with their own notes taken during lecture Since the professors do not spend time explaining fundamental biological concepts i e therelationship between DNA RNA and protein it is beneficial for students who have not taken biologyclasses before to do the textbook readings in advance to prepare for lecture as the professors will bebuilding upon these concepts To make the most of lectures it may also be beneficial for students to voice record them Given thetime constraints the professors will talk very fast and move at a brisk pace through the material However since the slides are very minimal it is often difficult to process the lecture as it is deliveredand transcribe the material into written form As a result voice recordings may be useful as studentsreview their course material I clickers are also used in lectures The clicker questions are for attendance and lecture participationpurposes Like all other assessment in EEB 211 the clicker questions are not straightforwardregurgitation problems Rather they are analytical and require students to go through the conceptspresented in lecture and synthesize an answer Although the clicker questions are multiple choice they provide an invaluable insight into the nature of questions students should expect on exams Theclicker questions are also useful during lecture for students to collectivize and logic through thematerial that was presented in lecture that day The only formal assignment in EEB 211 is the lab report Lab reports are questions and answerformat The professors will provide the students with a list of questions that the lab report mustanswer The questions increase in difficulty The first set of questions is largely data presentation asking students to describe what they observed The later questions ask students to analyze anddraw conclusions from the data i e is the data consistent with the concept of succession If not why not In order to succeed in the lab reports the student must be able to make a connectionbetween the lecture material and lab report questions One strategy may be go review all thelecture material for the week in which the lab was conducted before tackling the lab reportquestions Another strategy to tackle the lab reports is to start the assignment as soon as all thedata has been collected from the lab sessions While lab reports are not long assignments theanswers the TAs are looking for are very nuanced As a result it is a good idea to start to labreport and bring the rough draft to a TAs office hours before the report is due The TAs willprovide the general direction that they are looking for in the answers and they will also clarify anyquestions about relevant lecture concepts that the student may be confused about Learning from lab reports is invaluable The format of lab report questions mimic the format ofexam questions Like the exam questions the lab report questions seem open ended and opento student interpretation However the actual answers which garner full credit are very specificand nuanced There is a correct answer and partial credits are not generously given for answersthat are verbose but are ultimately wrong By putting a committed effort into lab reports studentswill foster the ability to connect biological concepts to examples in nature that is required tosuccess on exams Students will also learn to be succinct and present their responses in a clearmanner which is mandated by the page limit placed on all the lab reports The material presented in lecture is all students are expected to know to succeed in the course Forsupplemental instruction the TAs are a great resource The TAs hold office hours regularly and studentsare not restricted to only attending the office hours of their assigned TA Although TAs will not re teachlecture material nor will they give students the answer to lab report questions they will ask leadingquestions that prompt students to analyze the data in a certain direction and arrive at the correct answer Both professors also offer extensive hours Most importantly after the midterm students have the optionof signing up for an extensive interview with the professors to go through the exam in detail Theprofessors will not only explain the concepts addressed in each question but also explain to students theprocesses they should employ to reach the correct answer Students should know that the course is fast paced and detail orientated The professors assume thatstudents have a fundamental knowledge of biological concepts Students should also know that thecourse requires active engagement It is not a class that can be crammed the night before Much thecomprehension and ability to synthesize lecture content to big picture concepts comes from frequentreview of course materials It is also important to know that two very passionate and engaging professorsteach EEB 211 They are very enthusiastic and lively during lecture and encourage student curiosity ",

            "text": "The goal of the fall 2012 CHM 201 course with Professor Hecht is to cover abasic overview of chemistry for potential chemistry concentrators as well aspremedical and engineering candidates This course aims to introduce students toan introductory science class with an emphasis on the basic concepts behindchemical reactions equilibrium energy and entropy quantum theory atomicstructure and chemical bonding The course is divided into 11 units which often build onto each other Forexample the stoichiometry section is key for later calculations in CHM 201 while thegases section is not heavily elaborated upon in the upcoming weeks However alltopics are fundamental for future chemistry classes For instance you will have adifficult time in an upper level thermodynamics class if you do not know the basicideal gas law The course flows by moving quickly through concepts that several studentsencountered in high school and later slows down to cover the newer material Therefore this course rewards those who stick with it because it does slow down asthe term progresses so if a student did not take AP Chemistry he or she should notworry because the course will slow after cruising through the basics CHM 201 differs from a high school class due to its different teaching andexamination styles For example high school teachers will often have time to writeon the board each tidbit of information but with Princetons short semester ProfessorHecht moved quickly through a PowerPoint that did not explicitly state each definitionand concept Students are expected to review the concepts on their own outside ofclass in addition to simply doing the problem sets as well as ask questions in officehours precept the chemistry resource center study hall and McGraw Sundayreview session Textbook readings online activities ALEKS and problem sets are due eachweek Lectures consist of slide shows with not a significant amount of text andprecepts vary based on your section For example some preceptors create reviewsheets while others have simple question and answer sessions Furthermore because the lectures move at a fast pace to keep the students who have taken APChemistry engaged the textbook and online activities ALEKS serve as extraresources to explain the concepts more thoroughly In addition to the lecture and precept components of the course the labs alsoplay a crucial role in CHM 201 with RPL Although the labs frequently do not line upwith the lecture material explicitly they are intended to teach students basic labprotocol and perhaps more importantly preparation Students will learn that theywill leave lab very early if they are able to read the protocol ahead of time andvisualize the lab in their head before stepping foot in Frick In other words whenstudents arrive in lab they should have already done the lab in their heads Thisway they will be much more efficient in lab save time and RPL will like them more In sum while the lab does teach basic chemistry lab skills such as titration it alsoshows students the value in preparation Thus although lab lecture and preceptconcepts do not always fit together in terms of the specific topics all componentsteach the value of extra preparation and asking questions Learning to read a textbook and utilize the TAs can be challenging In particular the textbook wording can sometimes be confusing so underlining confusingsentences and later going into the chemistry resource center to ask about theunderlined information can help clarify concepts formulas but also understand their applications The exams often have moreapplication questions than problem sets but they are similar to other practice examsthat are made available Students should know that the practice exams not onlyserve as practice but also further explanation For example a new conceptapplication may be first introduced to a student on a practice exam so a student mayeven be at a severe disadvantage if he or she does not complete all three practiceexams sets and online activities students will learn just as much through this type ofpractice Furthermore because the practice exams which may be the mostimportant preparation for exams are not turned in the professor expects students tobe self disciplined and do the exams despite not getting direct credit for completion students learn to move efficiently through problems and learn what calculations theyneed to do quickly Again the TAs and professor will not know if a student does dothe exams timed so learning to be honest with yourself and not give yourself extratime on the practice exams is another challenge in the course also read the textbook closely ask questions self discipline and be honest withthemselves textbook with a highlighter next to them Students should highlight what they wouldwant to have on a cheat sheet for this class if they were allowed a cheat sheet It ishelpful to distill formulas and information into a readily summarized form because itwill save students time since they will not having to re read the text before exams ifthey are constantly adding to their summary sheet as they read the textbook and take notes in lecture For example they might simplyput a question mark in the margin of their notes in lecture next to a section thatconfused them but they can later formulate a question to ask in office hours Thistechnique of keeping a list of question is helpful because it ensures that no conceptsneaks past the student By checking off questions as they are asked students canmake sure that they get answers to their full list Furthermore students can ask TAsto explain ideas a second time if they do not understand the initial explanation Forinstance a student might ask Sorry I didnt quite catch that Can you please repeatwhat you just said about entropy Keep in mind that the TAs in the resource centermay be teaching chemistry concepts that they learned many years ago sosometimes it will take them a few tries to come up with a clear way to explain Inother words give them a few chances if they dont get it right immediately sure that they complete the practice exams Fake due dates can be helpful becauseotherwise students may put off the practice exams until the day before when officehours may be too crowded to get all of their questions answered For instance if theexam is on a Wednesday a self disciplined student might consider completing onepractice exam on Friday Saturday and Sunday so that he or she could getquestions answered on Monday and will avoid long lines at McGraw on Tuesday theday before the exam The examinations and problem sets require students to not only memorize in other words although the practice exams are not turned in like the problem additionally taking the exams under time constraints is challenging but can help to summarize students will be challenged to not only learn the concepts but given that the course demands close textbook readings students can read theto rise to the challenge of asking questions students can keep a list of questionsas for self discipline students can make a schedule with fake due dates to bein groups because seeing everyone else in the study group put their pencils downafter exactly 120 minutes will push students to put their own pencils down as well creating fake deadlines for the completion of practice exams and working in groupsunder timed conditions will help students meet the challenges of CHM 201 withProfessor Hecht I personally did not use external resources besides office hours and study hall but in general I find it helpful to google or even try youtube for tutorials on basicconcepts However for this course I found the textbook to be a great resource anddid not feel the need to look online in addition Sometimes I get more confusedwhen I look online because the internet goes more in depth than the class Forsome people this is fun though so if youre interested go for it CHM 201 in the fall of 2012 taught me basic chemistry concepts but moreimportantly it taught me how to use Princetons academic resources I wish that Ihad known that this course does in fact slow down as the term progresses becauseknowing that future concepts would be explained with more detail would have mademe feel better at the beginning of the term As for timing it ranges depending on how much chemistry you have had in thepast how fast you can read the textbook etc While I do not feel comfortablepublishing a certain number of hours I will say that it is more work than mostintroductory classes because it is a lab course but less than a typical lab course atPrinceton This course taught me that introductory courses at Princeton are often gearedtowards a variety of backgrounds so even students who may feel behind the rest ofthe class at the start still have a chance to do well on the final if they utilize theresources around them Thus I would recommend taking this course early in aPrinceton career because its teachings apply not only to chemistry but also to theway other quantitative classes can be approached ",
