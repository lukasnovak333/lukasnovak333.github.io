NULL,Introduction to the Study of African American Cultural Practices , Imani Perry , As the introductory course required to concentrate or earn a certificate in African American Studies  this course examines the past and present  the doings and the sufferings of Americans of African descent from a multidisciplinary perspective. It highlights the ways in which serious intellectual scrutiny of the agency of black people in the United States help redefine what it means to be American  new world  modern and post modern , AAS 201 , SA ,4.226666666666667,AAS
NULL,What's So Funny? Forms of African American Humor , Kinohi Nishikawa , What's so funny? is a question that could be turned around to ask: Who's laughing? Comedian Dave Chappelle might say it's a question about who gets the joke  and who doesn't. This survey of African American humor is an introduction to getting the joke. We study the technical artistry of black humorists and comedians and reflect on the audiences for whom they write and perform. We examine a range of cultural expression  from the dozens to stand-up comedy. In our critical and creative work  we assess how past forms and strategies can be adapted to the project of African American humor today. , AAS 212 ENG 212 , LA ,4.3759999999999994,AAS
NULL,Harlem Renaissance and Black Arts Movements , Chika O. Okeke-Agulu , This course surveys important moments in 20th-Century African American art from the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s to the 1960s Black Arts movement.

NULL,Black to the Future: Science  Fiction  and Society , Ruha Benjamin ," Designer Babies. Ancestry Tests. Organ Regeneration. Biometric Surveillance. These and more comprise our 21st century landscape. This interdisciplinary course examines the values and politics that shape science  medicine  and technology  asking who bears the risk and who reaps the benefit of innovations? Social inequality is legitimized  in part  by myths about human difference. And while course participants grapple with past and present stories that shape science and technology  we also apply a sociological imagination to the future  exploring how contemporary hopes and fears may give rise to ""real utopias"" that are more equitable and just.

NULL,Rats  Riots  and Revolution: Housing in the Metropolitan United States , Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor ," This class examines the history of urban and suburban housing in the twentieth century US. We will examine the relationship between postwar suburban development as a corollary to the ""underdevelopment"" of American cities contributing to what scholars have described as the ""urban crisis"" of the 1960s. Housing choice and location were largely shaped by discriminatory practices in the real estate market  thus  the course explores the consequences of the relationship between public policy and private institutions in shaping the metropolitan area including after the passage of federal anti-housing discrimination legislation in the late 1960s.

NULL,Public Policy in the U.S. Racial State , Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor , This course explores how ideas and discourses about race shape how public policy is debated  adopted  and implemented. Black social movements and geopolitical considerations prompted multiple public policy responses to racial discrimination throughout the twentieth century. Despite these policy responses  discrimination persists  raising theoretical concerns about the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion  political representation  the role of the state (meaning government or law) in promoting social justice  and the role of social movements and civil society in democratizing policymaking and addressing group oppression. , AAS 380 AMS 382 , HA ,4.7780000000000005,AAS

Gerwin ," The study of public health is an interdisciplinary inquiry involving issues of politics  policy  history  science  law  philosophy  ethics  geography  sociology  environmental studies  and economics  among others. Students will examine the government's role in assuring and promoting health  through the exploration of issues on America's ""public health agenda "" such as epidemic response  tobacco use  the impact of weight on health  mandatory vaccination  disease prevention  and violence. In doing so  they will consider the impact of race  income  gender  place and environment  education  capitalism and democracy on health outcomes. ", AMS 306 GHP 411 , SA ,4.244,AMS
NULL,Sugar: A Commodity History of the United States , Bernadette J. Perez , Moving from the colonial era to the present  and from the Caribbean to the Midwest and the Pacific  we will place sugar in the history of European colonialism  trans-Atlantic slavery  capitalism  American Empire  and global immigration restrictions. During this period  the United States built a sugar empire that relied upon differentially racialized laborers  who worked under a variety of coercive labor systems. We will explore how the production and consumption of sugar connected diverse people and places in unequal ways  focusing on themes such as labor  migration  race  gender  citizenship  identity  power  resistance  and the land. , AMS 353 HIS 445 , HA ,-1,AMS
NULL,Environmental and Social Crisis , Laurel Mei-Singh ," In recent years  public discourse has stressed the urgency of impending environmental crisis. With the premise that ""there's no such thing as a natural disaster "" we will explore the social and political elements of environmental crisis. Our baseline definition of crisis will be: a moment when an existing set of relations is markedly upset. We will look at how war and capitalism precipitate environmental crises and how state and corporate institutions also benefit from these disasters. Our studies will begin with apocalyptic texts--which are reflections and exaggerations of existing realities--alongside environmental justice scholarship. ", AMS 364 ENV 365 , EM ,3.96,AMS
NULL,American Noir: Crime Fiction and Film , Lee C. Mitchell , A study of the emergence during the high modernist period of two genres that might be considered at once eminently American  distinctively modernist  and brazenly vulgar. The subject matter may be louche  but writers thereby more directly engaged issues of social inequality (racial  sexual  and economic)  along with changing images of gender construction. As well they registered the impact of Freudian psychoanalysis on literary form  and in formal terms engaged the belatedness of narrative to event. Such fiction had tremendous appeal for cinema  and we will focus on the ways in which adaptation modified popular formulas. , AMS 367 , LA ,-1,AMS
NULL,American Legal Thought , Hendrik A. Hartog ," This course surveys American legal thought and the practices of American lawyers. Along the way  it questions the notion of distinctive ""schools "" as well as the distinctive legality and the distinctive Americanness of legal thought. It offers an intellectual history of 20th century American law  with an emphasis on core controversies and debates. ", AMS 390 HIS 382 , EM ,-1,AMS
NULL,In the Groove: Technology and Music in American History  From Edison to the iPod , Emily Thompson , When Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877  no one  including Edison  knew what to do with the device. Over the next century Americans would engage in an ongoing dialogue with this talking machine  defining and redefining its purpose. This course will track that trajectory  from business tool to scientific instrument to music recorder to musical instrument. By listening to the history of the phonograph  and by examining the desires and experiences of phonograph users  students will perceive more generally the complex relationships that exist between a technology and the people who produce  consume  and transform it. , AMS 399 HIS 399 , HA ,4.4766666666666675,AMS
NULL,Introduction to Anthropology , Naomi S. Stone , This course provides an introduction to core anthropological modes of inquiry into being human across space and time. Engaging key concepts of culture as lenses on contemporary phenomena  we will explore universalism and variation across societies. How do communities express difference and identity  make meaning  transmit knowledge  circulate objects and power  live  love  wish and dream? Case-studies vary  from women's piety movements in Cairo to the role of mosquitos  germs  and machines in making lives and worlds. We will also consider anthropology's colonial origins  examining intersections between knowledge and domination. , ANT 201 , SA ,3.2816666666666667,ANT
NULL,Religion  Ideology  and Media , Carolyn M. Rouse , This course explores how media shapes cultural and social identities. From televangelism to political talk radio  the mass marketing of faith and political ideologies is contributing to how people understand themselves as gendered  raced  and classed subjects. But are these programs helping to sustain a fragile consensus within our nation-state  or is this media threatening radical disunity? This course examines what is at stake culturally in this religious and ideological war of symbols generated within mediascapes. , ANT 208 REL 208 , SA ,3.9799999999999995,ANT
NULL,Debt , Julia Elyachar ," Average credit card debt of Americans is $16 000; average college loan debt $30 000. How and why do people go into debt? Why is debt negatively linked to ""usury"" in some cultures while in others not having debt is a mark of being ""underleveraged""? How can ""debt"" sometimes be an instrument of social solidarity and other times be a source of social discord? In this course we will draw on history  political theory  economics  and anthropology to look at debates about ""debt"" in different places and times as diverse as 4th century Greece  18th century England  19th century Egypt  and the 2008 Financial Crisis and its aftermath around the world. ", ANT 225 , SA ,-1,ANT
NULL,Social Lives  Social Forces , Carol J. Greenhouse , This seminar takes up the connection between authority and obligation as a cultural question. We draw on diverse sources (anthropology  case studies  social theory  literature  public documents  art  etc.) to probe conceptual and real-life gray zones between individual and community  liberty and constraint  state and private sector. We consider formal and informal institutions (e.g.  courts  legislatures  police  workplaces  families) and a range of formal and informal norms (from court rulings to common sense). Authority and obligation emerge as complex social relations that shape and are shaped within and across cultural contexts. , ANT 232 , SA ,4.292,ANT
NULL,Ethnography  Evidence and Experience , Rena S. Lederman ," This course connects ethnographic theory (e.g.  about culture  relationality  context  and interpretation) to everyday experience and vice versa. Readings from academic and media sources align with weekly journal writing to cultivate students' ethnographic awareness of their own and others' embodied knowledge and the ethics  politics  and ritual dimensions of relationships  language  and more. Throughout we scrutinize how ""experience"" becomes ethnographic ""evidence"" and how the immediacies of participant-observation fieldwork bear on wide-angle questions about power/value hierarchies  historical and cultural context  and societal dynamics.

NULL,Forensic Anthropology and Epigenetics in Urban America , Jeffrey D. Himpele   Janet M. Monge ," Forensic anthropology involves medico-legal cases where human remains have lost ""personhood"" (an individual cannot be identified due to decomposition or destruction of unique personal features). We will explore techniques of analysis that biological anthropologists apply to forensic cases. We will blend the sub-disciplines of social and biological anthropology by tracing the intertwined physiological and social factors that shape human variation and life experience in an urban setting. We weigh and consider epigenetic mechanisms by which external variables may bring about heritable molecular changes in the expression of genetic phenotypes. ", ANT 309A STC 310A , SA ,-1,ANT

NULL,Language  Identity  Power , Serguei A. Oushakine ," Language determines our expressive capacities  represents our identities  and connects us with each other across various platforms and cultures.This course introduces classical and contemporary approaches to studying language  focusing on three main areas: 1) language as a system of rules and regulations (""structure"")  2) language as a symbolic mechanism through which individuals and groups mark their presence (""identity"") and 3) language as a means of communication (""sign""). In addition to this  the course examines various ways through which language molds our individual selves: from organizing dreams and desires to shaping autobiographies.

NULL,Ethnography of Schools and Schooling , Jason R. Klugman , Social scientists use ethnographic methods to describe and analyze the range and variation of daily interactions in schools. Ethnographic study allows researchers the opportunity to examine power dynamics that influence the daily life of students  teachers  administrators and parents. Vivid  critical ethnography helps us discover how cultural traditions  expectations  and opportunities are passed down to the next generation and how they impact school outcomes. This class will explore educational ethnography and students will complete observations hours in local schools and prepare a descriptive  mini-ethnography of a school community. , ANT 368 TPP 368 , SA ,4.36,ANT
NULL,History of Anthropological Theory , Carol J. Greenhouse , The course surveys the development of social anthropology by examining the concepts and models used by anthropologists to analyze human diversity and universals  social stability and change  and the relationship between the individual and the group. We explore theoretical debates (evolution  exchange  function  structure  culture  agency  subjectivity  history  power  and globalization) in terms of their capacity to understand human behavior  the social world and modernity. , ANT 390A , HA ,-1,ANT

NULL,Memory  Trauma  Accountability , John W. Borneman , We focus on how humans deal with traumatic loss through three major approaches to memory: psychoanalysis (Freud)  social organization (Halbwachs)  associative temporalities (Sebald). We examine genres in which the memory of loss is retained or displaced. How is a traumatic past experienced individually and collectively? We consider memory from different cultural landscapes and theoretical perspectives. A better understanding of the memory of loss  and the social forms and histories in which this memory remains active  will improve our approaches to cultural observation  documentation  analysis  and interpretation. , ANT 432 , SA ,4.5,ANT
NULL,The Anthropology of Ruins , Andrew A. Johnson , We think about ruins as belonging to the past  but they do not. They are that detritus that stays with us into the present. They can be sources of melancholy  inspiration  wonder  and horror; or lingering toxins in the soil  racist legacies of colonialism  nationalistic points of collective sentiment  and the remnants of past cities bleeding through into the present-day urban landscape. This course will examine ruins anthropologically. Students should come out of this class with an introduction to the anthropology of aesthetics  the relationship between space and place  and a new appreciation for urban infrastructures and their legacies. , ANT 445 , SA ,-1,ANT

NULL,Topics in Theory & Practice (Half-Term) - Peopling Critical Theory , João Biehl , This seminar explores how contemporary anthropologists study  think  and write about power  agency  and the nature of social change  and probe the various theoretical frameworks that inform their work. We will engage scholars who mine ethnography as a mode of expression through multiple media and for diverse publics. Through which means can we illuminate both political-economic and personal realities-in-flux  and how can we bring this plasticity and unfinishedness into our storytelling? How does ethnography challenge present-day regimes of veridiction and how can the lives of our subjects become alternative figures of thought and critique? , ANT 521B ,,-1,ANT
NULL,Topics in Social Anthropology - Temporality and Ethnography , Carol J. Greenhouse , Durkheim's concept of social time continues to sustain a broad and varied ethnography; however  it encounters limits in his explicit distinction between social time and the personal experience of time. That disjunction vitiates the potential relevance of temporality as a critical resource - or set of resources - for ethnography. The seminar unsettles that distinction from various angles  and explores the relevance of temporality in current ethnographic writing on law  politics  labor  forms of life beyond the human  and ethnography itself. The purpose of the seminar is to bring new times to ethnographic inquiry. , ANT 541 ,,-1,ANT

NULL,The Philosophy of Urban History , Manuel J. DeLanda , The class introduces students to the branch of the philosophy of history that specializes in cities. Cities are social entities that exist at an intermediate scale between the micro-level of individuals and the macro-level of society as a whole. Social science has tended to focus at those two extremes  while the intermediate meso-level has been neglected. The philosophy of urban history aims at remedying this situation  stressing not only the role of cities as historical actors  but also the role of other meso-level social entities from local communities and institutional organizations to urban regions and provinces. , ARC 545 ,,4.08,ARC

NULL,Research in Architecture - The Supernormal and the Transgressive , Beatriz Colomina , Architecture is understood as having a normalizing function  establishing patterns that are stable  predictable  and to some extent standardized. The right angle is called the normal and it is very hard to find in nature. The right angle belongs to culture  to architecture. Architecture sees itself as the caretaker of the normal. But the normal is not normal. It is a kind of artifact  always produced  never found. It is a construction involving a certain violence. Meanwhile there is a hidden tradition in architecture of the transgressive  work that crosses the lines of the normal  complicating these lines  threatening the limit. , ARC 571 ART 581 MOD 573 ,,4.266,ARC

NULL,Advanced Topics in Modern Architecture - Architecture in/as Photography , Jean-Louis Cohen , The emergence of Modern architecture coincides with the invention of photography  a medium that not only has reshaped the reception of buildings  but has also been often mobilized within the sphere of architectural design itself. Since the mid-19th century  architects have produced and used photographs. Building and cityscapes have provided photography with some of its most challenging themes and have forced major transformations in the photographic discourse. The seminar discusses the work of photographers who have responded to architecture and contemporary ones  and of artists or architects who have either produced photographs or used them. , ARC 575 ,,3.66,ARC
NULL,Topics in Contemporary Architectural Theory - Postmodern Procedures , Sylvia Lavin , The emergence of postmodern architecture coincides with the rise of the white collar worker. Where the modern architect was concerned with industrial labor  the postmodern architect was overrun by paperwork. Not only did an increasingly labyrinthine bureaucracy and regulated profession subtend the production of buildings  but a rich array of clerical protocols entered the logic of design itself. This course explores a series of procedures that came into prominence around 1965  from the survey to the purchase order  that address the often unexpectedly productive encounters between postmodernization and architecture. , ARC 577 MOD 577 ,,4.192,ARC
